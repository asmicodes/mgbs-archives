        melted,
        and the international community is racing desperately to claim the massive amounts of oil beneath the newly
        accessible
        ocean. Enter the Gaia Corporation. Its two founders have come up with a plan to roll back global warming.
        Thousands of
        tiny mirrors floating in the air can create a giant sunshade, capable of redirecting heat and cooling the
        earth's
        surface. They plan to terraform Earth to save it from itself-but in doing so, they have created a superweapon
        the
        likes of which the world has never seen. Anika Duncan is an airship pilot for the underfunded United Nations
        Polar
        Guard. She's intent on capturing a smuggled nuclear weapon that has made it into the Polar Circle and bringing
        the
        smugglers to justice. Anika finds herself caught up in a plot by a cabal of military agencies and corporations
        who
        want Gaia Corporation stopped. But when Gaia Corp loses control of their superweapon, it will be Anika who has

      <li>Bea’s five-year-old daughter, Agnes, is slowly wasting away, consumed by the smog and pollution of the
        overdeveloped
        metropolis that most of the population now calls home. If they stay in the city, Agnes will die. There is only
        one
        alternative: the Wilderness State, the last swath of untouched, protected land, where people have always been
        forbidden. Until now. Bea, Agnes, and eighteen others volunteer to live in the Wilderness State, guinea pigs in
        an
        experiment to see if humans can exist in nature without destroying it. Living as nomadic hunter-gatherers, they
        slowly

        as

        saving her daughter’s life means losing her in a different way. The farther they get from civilization, the more

        winning, Benton learns from his predecessor that previous estimates regarding the effect of global warming on
        rising
        sea levels have been grossly underestimated. For the United States, a leading carbon emitter for decades, the
        prospects are devastating: thirty million coastal-dwelling citizens will need to be relocated; Miami will be

      <li>Patrick Hamlin arrives in Hollywood to assume a vague role on the set of the movie version of his latest
        novel.
        But
        everything about the process is befuddling—the movie script barely resembles his story, and his role is
        relegated
        to
        listening to the semiphilosophical ramblings of the production assistants and transporting Cassidy Carter, the
        tempestuous former child actor–turned–B-lister that is starring in the film. Patrick is increasingly alarmed by
        the
        things he witnesses: Wildfires flare constantly; everyone drinks a luxe synthetic product called WAT-R that is
        “the
        same as water, just a little bit more so.” And there is a mysterious “dementia” that is afflicting people
        seemingly at
        random, regardless of age. As the surrealism of the film-set experiences blend with the nightmarishness of LA,
        Patrick
        is also coming unglued by developments at home: His emotionally fragile wife and their 9-year-old daughter are
        staying
        at an upstate New York commune, where they participate in group mourning rituals as a kind of ecological grief
        work.
        It isn’t long before everything in Patrick’s life feels like it’s spiraling toward disaster. Kleeman’s novel is
        idea-driven, a critique of the artifice of consumerism and Hollywood culture in which that artifice is
        heightened
        on
        each page, from characters talking in polished soliloquies to the ominous ubiquity of WAT-R bottles in
        everyone’s
        hands. Everything in this world is deliberately just a little bit off, like the slight telltale warp of a
        Photoshopped
        selfie. While some readers might find the novel overly conceptual, it’s undeniably fun to watch Kleeman juggle
        genre,
        from mystery to domestic drama, from cli-fi to ghost story. An admirably eclectic take on environmental
        dystopia.</li>

      <li>The Carbon Diaries by Saci Lloyd is a 2011 book set in the then near future of 2015 London. The UK is
        implementing
        carbon rationing after a catastrophic storm brings the reality of climate change into full focus. Laura lives
        with
        her
        Mum, Dad and antisocial older sister Kim. It is through first person diary-fiction that we are drawn into a
        world
        not
        too dissimilar from our own in which society is “addicted to oil and gas” (Lloyd 2011, pp. 25). Laura tries to
        go
        through the motions of everyday life, negotiating family conflict, changing friendships, sexuality and
        education,
        but
        her life is frequently disrupted by extremely volatile weather patterns. The clippings and images throughout the
        book
        enhance the immersion of the reader and lend credence to the diary as a fictional found artefact. The novel
        introduces
        the new world order of environmental awareness and resource austerity with the idea of carbon rations. This
        system
        of
        rationing restricts the luxuries of the inhabitants of London and forces them to pay attention to their carbon
        consumption, balancing their use of energy and resources. The young people in the narrative experience a period
        of
        adjustment which causes them to confront how they define youth and necessity. As the novel progresses the
        response
        to
        the carbon restrictions begins to normalise and the storms and droughts highlight the need for extreme action on
        climate change.</li>

        chance for Beard to extricate himself from his marital mess, reinvigorate his career and very possibly save the
        world
        from environmental disaster. With a global scope, Solar is a comedy dealing directly with the crises of today. A

      <li>After the climate wars, a floating city is constructed in the Arctic Circle, a remarkable feat of mechanical
        and
        social engineering, complete with geothermal heating and sustainable energy. The city’s denizens have become
        accustomed to a roughshod new way of living, however, the city is starting to fray along the edges—crime and
        corruption have set in, the contradictions of incredible wealth alongside direst poverty are spawning unrest,
        and
        a
        new disease called “the breaks” is ravaging the population. When a strange new visitor arrives—a woman riding an
        orca,
        with a polar bear at her side—the city is entranced. The “orcamancer,” as she’s known, very subtly brings
        together
        four people—each living on the periphery—to stage unprecedented acts of resistance. By banding together to save
        their
        city before it crumbles under the weight of its own decay, they will learn shocking truths about themselves.
        Blackfish
        City is a remarkably urgent—and ultimately very hopeful—novel about political corruption, organized crime,
        technology
        run amok, the consequences of climate change, gender identity, and the unifying power of human connection.

    <ul class="annotation">
      <li>"The Heatstroke Line" is a novel that shows what climate change will do to the United States. It is intended
        as
        a
        warning. Many Americans are willing to deny the reality of climate change because they think that it will only
        affect
        tropical countries and oceanic islands that are far away from us. The Heatstroke Line depicts a United States
        that
        with its coastal cities flooded and its remaining land sweltering under debilitating heat. It has broken into
        smaller
        units that are in conflict with each other and it is dominated by more northerly nations, such as Canada, that
        now
        have temperate climates. There are already a number of "cli-fi" novels that deal with global warming. But most
        of
        these belong within the category of post-apocalyptic science fiction. They use a disaster — nuclear war,
        epidemic
        or
        ecological disaster — to wipe away the complexities or modern civilization and tell an adventure story. The
        Heatstroke
        Line is different. It shows an imaginable future, not very distant from the present, when there are still modern
        houses, cars, governments, schools and political conflicts. The purpose is to bring home to Americans the
        devastating
        effects that climate change might have on our nation. “The Heatstroke Line" is a real story — relatively short,
        filled
        with action and written in simple, easy to read prose. It does not preach and it does not try to advance
        scientific
        arguments. Its goal is to make the consequences of climate change real and immediate. It is intended to motivate
        people who believe that climate change is real to take action, and to induce those who deny climate change to
        re-think
        their position.</li>

      <li>The Ministry for the Future is a masterpiece of the imagination, using fictional eyewitness accounts to tell
        the
        story of how climate change will affect us all. Its setting is not a desolate, postapocalyptic world, but a
        future
        that is almost upon us. Chosen by Barack Obama as one of his favorite books of the year, this extraordinary
        novel
        from

        Established in 2025, the purpose of the new organization was simple: To advocate for the world’s future

        in
        which we might just overcome the extraordinary challenges we face. It is a novel both immediate and impactful,
        desperate and hopeful in equal measure, and it is one of the most powerful and original books on climate change

        and
        venture with her, into a hot zone teeming with treacherous nomads and a Fireseed cult who worships his dead

        describes
        a globally overcooked and devastated Earth divided into three sociopolitical regions: the Hotzone, where
        burn-scarred
        workers struggle to survive in 160 degree temperatures; Land Dominion, where realtor Melvyn Baron builds an
        empire

        exploiting the Hotzone and its people; and Ocean Dominion, where newly orphaned teen hero Varik Teitur runs a

        farm. But when Marisa Baron—the idealistic, rebellious teenage daughter of Melvyn—and her activist friends break

      <li>In this brilliant, essential book, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Thomas L. Friedman speaks to America's urgent
        need
        for national renewal and explains how a green revolution can bring about both a sustainable environment and a
        sustainable America. Friedman explains how global warming, rapidly growing populations, and the expansion of the
        world’s middle class through globalization have produced a dangerously unstable planet--one that is "hot, flat,
        and
        crowded." In this Release 2.0 edition, he also shows how the very habits that led us to ravage the natural world
        led
        to the meltdown of the financial markets and the Great Recession. Friedman proposes that an ambitious national
        strategy—which he calls “Geo-Greenism”—is not only what we need to save the planet from overheating; it is what
        we
        need to make America healthier, richer, more innovative, more productive, and more secure. The challenge of a
        sustainable way of life presents the United States with an opportunity not only to rebuild its economy, but to
        lead
        the world in radically innovating toward cleaner energy. And it could inspire Americans to something we haven't
        seen
        in a long time--nation-building in America--by summoning the intelligence, creativity, and concern for the
        common
        good
        that are our greatest national resources.</li>

      <li>#1 bestseller, winner of the Hilary Weston Writers' Trust Prize for Non-Fiction, and Naomi Klein's most
        important
        book yet--about the economic drivers that are warming our planet and how the climate crisis can yet spur
        economic,
        cultural and political transformation. Klein argues that our current growth-based economic model is waging war
        on
        the
        life support systems of our planet. Using phenomenal research, she lays out why climate change is not an
        "issue"--it
        is a civilizational wake-up call, a powerful message delivered in the language of fires, floods, storms and
        droughts.
        Klein attacks the dominant economic policies of deregulated capitalism and endless resource extraction, and
        brilliantly identifies the threads that connect our failed responses to the crisis--from hard-core climate
        deniers
        to
        celebrity billionaires with messiah complexes, to the reckless quest to engineer the planet--and she reveals how
        the
        "Big Green" environmental organizations may be hurting more than helping. She argues that we urgently need an
        entirely
        new model of human progress and shows why climate change--with its full economic and moral implications
        understood--is
        the most powerful weapon we have ever had in the fight for equality and social justice. Tracing the rise of a
        bold
        new
        resistance movement against extreme energy, she highlights the real solutions emerging in the rubble of our
        failed
        systems--solutions that require us to break virtually every rule in the free-market playbook. The climate change
        debate is about to get a lot hotter.</li>

      <li>Elizabeth Kolbert's environmental classic Field Notes from a Catastrophe first developed out of a
        groundbreaking,
        National Magazine Award-winning three-part series in The New Yorker. She expanded it into a still-concise yet
        richly
        researched and damning book about climate change: a primer on the greatest challenge facing the world today.But
        in
        the
        years since, the story has continued to develop; the situation has become more dire, even as our understanding
        grows.
        Now, Kolbert returns to the defining book of her career. She has added a chapter bringing things up-to-date on
        the
        existing text, plus three new chapters--on ocean acidification, the tar sands, and a Danish town that's gone
        carbon
        neutral--making it, again, a must-read for our moment. Long known for her insightful and thought-provoking
        political
        journalism, author Elizabeth Kolbert now tackles the controversial and increasingly urgent subject of global
        warming.
        In what began as groundbreaking three-part series in the New Yorker, for which she won a National Magazine Award
        in
        2006, Kolbert cuts through the competing rhetoric and political agendas to elucidate for Americans what is
        really
        going on with the global environment and asks what, if anything, can be done to save our planet. Now updated and
        with
        a new afterword, Field Notes from a Catastrophe is the book to read on the defining issue and greatest challenge
        of
        our times.</li>

      <li>Reissued on the tenth anniversary of its publication, this classic work on our environmental crisis features a
        new
        introduction by the author, reviewing both the progress and ground lost in the fight to save the earth. This
        impassioned plea for radical and life-renewing change is today still considered a groundbreaking work in
        environmental
        studies. McKibben’s argument that the survival of the globe is dependent on a fundamental, philosophical shift
        in
        the
        way we relate to nature is more relevant than ever. McKibben writes of our earth’s environmental cataclysm,
        addressing
        such core issues as the greenhouse effect, acid rain, and the depletion of the ozone layer. His new introduction
        addresses some of the latest environmental issues that have risen during the 1990s. The book also includes an
        invaluable new appendix of facts and figures that surveys the progress of the environmental movement. More than
        simply
        a handbook for survival or a doomsday catalog of scientific prediction, this classic, soulful lament on Nature
        is
        required reading for nature enthusiasts, activists, and concerned citizens alike.

      <li>Pressia barely remembers the Detonations or much about life during the Before. In her sleeping cabinet behind
        the
        rubble of an old barbershop where she lives with her grandfather, she thinks about what is lost -
        how the world
        went
        from amusement parks, movie theaters, birthday parties, fathers and mothers . . . to ash and dust, scars,
        permanent
        burns, and fused, damaged bodies. And now, at an age when everyone is required to turn themselves over to the
        militia
        to either be trained as a soldier or, if they are too damaged and weak, to be used as live targets, Pressia can

        There are those who escaped the apocalypse unmarked. Pures. They are tucked safely inside the Dome that protects
        their
        healthy, superior bodies. Yet Partridge, whose father is one of the most influential men in the Dome, feels
        isolated
        and lonely. Different. He thinks about loss-maybe just because his family is broken; his father is emotionally
        distant; his brother killed himself; and his mother never made it inside their shelter. Or maybe it's his
        claustrophobia: his feeling that this Dome has become a swaddling of intensely rigid order. So when a slipped
        phrase
        suggests his mother might still be alive, Partridge risks his life to leave the Dome to find her.

        When Pressia meets Partridge, their worlds shatter all over again.</li>
