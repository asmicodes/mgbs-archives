    <div class="annotation">This text focuses on why YA Dystopian and post-apocalypse texts should be taught in schools,
      and how exposing students to such texts benefits their understanding of the world and politics. Alfes and her team
      demonstrate the benefits of including YA post-apocalypse and dystopian texts in secondary school curriculums
      through four case studies. Teachers noticed that the implementation of such texts had the potential of improving
      language efficiency in students, the texts were versatile and opened intercultural discussion amongst students,
      thereby broadening their knowledge on thematic ideologies, and exposure to the texts also improved students’
      critical thinking skills. This text offers insight into the ways YA literature can be used in academic settings,
      and how forming an educational framework that targets discussion on climate change through these novels can help
      improve student engagement on the matter. As demonstrated through the case studies, YA literature has the capacity
      to not only engage students’ in topics about climate change but to also push them into feeling concern for their
      planet. As such, understanding ways in which this genre neglects to forefront issues of climate change, and
      merging it with educational curriculums can help format a potential framework to better connect students with the
      environment.</div>

    <div class="annotation">Summarizing the plots of the four following YA books: Ship Breaker by Paolo Bacigalupi, Ella
      Minnow Pea by Mark Dunn, The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman, and I am Malala by Malala Yousafzai, this essay
      demonstrates the ways in which themes of community connect students to each other and the novels. The essay
      focuses on how “[q]uality young adult literature can provide a vehicle for facilitating the exploration of
      community, its role in young people’s lives, and adolescents’ place within it” (55). In each summary, Anderson,
      Goldsworthy, and MacQueen focus on elements that the text offers in relation to adolescent identity. In Ship
      Breaker, for instance, they highlight how morality, interrelationships, and social class differences are few of
      the many themes evident in the narrative. Ultimately, the essay highlights how young readers can learn and build
      their own identities through the way the character grows. This essay offers a quick look into the potential ways
      YA literature can be taught to students in order to forefront complex and intersectional issues such as climate
      change, or race. By focusing curriculums or conversations on specific themes that are highlighted in the article,
      youth can better connect with their environment can develop their understanding of complex real-world issues.

    </div>
    <div class="annotation">Bach and Peters examine the benefits of including a YA speculative fiction novel in school
      curriculums. Using three class examples, the authors demonstrate the ways in which students engage in critical
      thinking skills as they are exposed to complex themes and ideas within the narrative. By encouraging students to
      ask and imagine “what if,” scenarios students can partake in better understanding themes such as death, class,
      race, and nature, and partake in imagining possible futures that can answer these questions. This paper will be
      particularly helpful in highlighting the potential benefits of using speculative fiction as a way to teach younger
      demographic about climate change. By implementing texts that pertain to the problem of climate change in school
      curriculums, students can more actively partake in discussion about the issue. Students can use the narrative to
      understand the potential impacts of climate change and feel more motivated to become active political agents in
      their own lives.</div>

      <span class="remaining-citation"> <i>The New York Times17 </i>(2012).</span>
    </div>
    <div class="annotation">In this article, Bacigalupi points out the ability of YA speculative fiction to offer truth
      to teenagers. He explains that in his own novel, Ship Breaker, he wanted “to illuminate the sort of world that we
      adults are handing off to [youth].” Bacigalupi highlights the necessity of being truthful to teenagers who know
      that they will “inherit a world significantly depleted and damaged.” He contends that by teaching youth about the
      world through fiction, they will be better equipped and more passionate about preventing their world from further
      deterioration. In this way, YA speculative fiction offers youth the ability to not only learn about real world
      issues, but to form a personal understanding of the consequences that these issues may result in. Utilizing YA
      speculative fiction as a tool to better warn and advise the teenage demographic about the realities of climate
      change, for instance, would be vital in combatting the effects of climate change. Centralizing issues on climate
      change will not only reinforce awareness amongst teenagers but might offer a platform to motivate activism in the
      future. This text reinstates the importance and influence of the genre in creating political identity within
      youth.</div>

    </div>
    <div class="annotation">Brisman tackles the subject of climate change in children’s book. He begins by outlining the
      history of climate change and its growing prominence in the present world. After reinforcing the growing imminence
      of climate change, and outlining the potential and current effects we are seeing because of it. Brisman then
      examines the implications of excluding children from the political realm who he argues will “experience the
      adverse cultural, economic, environmental and social impacts of climate change in qualitatively different,
      disproportional, and worse ways than adults” (264). He contends that increasing “[c]hildren’s engagement with
      environmental concerns” have reduced desensitization in adults and motivates them to become more environmentally
      active (269). Through analyses of various children stories, including “Green Santa,” he demonstrates the problems
      in the way climate change is presented to children. He considers the effects of romanticizing, if not entirely
      neglecting, topics of climate change in children’s narratives. His analysis highlights the importance of
      recognizing youth as a political participant. Moreover, his work outlines ways in which political agendas have
      skewed the way climate change is presented in texts. His analysis would be helpful in determining the ways climate
      change is presented in YA literature, as well as the importance of finding identity within and through nature.

      <span class="title">“Crisis, Continuity and Change: Neoliberalism, the Left and the Future of Capitalism.”</span>
      <span class="remaining-citation"> <i>Antipode </i> 41 (2010): 185-213.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="annotation">In this article, Noel discusses how capitalism has progressed over the ages, and how this
      has led to the current impending economic collapse. Using four theorists, he examines the ways in which capitalism
      and neoliberalism has propelled the world towards impending recession, and how this, in turn, works to
      deprioritize issues like climate change. Noel examines whether it is possible to move into the “post-neoliberal
      world,” and showcases that “even in neoliberalism’s heartlands, in the thick of financial crisis, there is only
      weak impetus for change” (186). This article highlights the ways in which it has become more economically
      beneficial to avoid discussing or funding the issue of climate change at all. Noel contends that capitalistic and
      individualistic mindsets have overwhelmed the number needed for grassroot movements and parties to fulfill their
      agendas, and how other factors like low social mobility, social inequality, and poverty (to name a few) have
      inhibited progress necessary for change. Furthermore the politicization of grassroot parties, and the neglect to
      vote for green parties has further exacerbated the issue of climate change rather than offer solutions. Noel
      offers an economic and political framework that can be used to demonstrate the reasons why there is a lack of
      conversation about climate change.</div>

      <span class="authors">Cerqueira, Tânia.</span>
      <span class="title">“Pandemics in Young Adult Dystopian Fiction: Rethinking the (Post) Human.”</span>
      <span class="remaining-citation">SFRA Review (2021).</span>
    </div>
    <div class="annotation">This article examines the importance of posthumanism in YA post-apocalypse and dystopian
      novels. Cerqueira argues that the post-human form challenges human/non-human binaries which is vital in order to
      forge a connection to nature. She considers how explorations of pandemics in which “the loss of human life, the
      paranoia caused by the fear of being infected, the struggle to find a cure, and how the infection (or the cure)
      can alter the human body” affect literature and force readers “to rethink what it actually means to be human.”
      Cerqueira’s analysis can be used to examine the ways in which human bodies interact with nature in the
      post-apocalypse or dystopian world. Through her readings texts like The Maze Runner, or Wilder Girls, or The Lunar
      Chronicles, Cerqueira showcases how the transformation of children from human to post-human allows these
      characters to reconnect with nature and transcend what it means to be human. Transformed bodies “question and
      dismantle the aforementioned binaries. … [and] have the power to change perceptions, to open dialogue, and to
      unveil how powerful is the connection between human/monster, human/Other, and human/animal.” By imagining
      identities beyond human and deconstructing what it means to be human, narratives can open space to interact with
      the environment outside of the norm. The posthuman, she determines, is the solution to seeing and developing a
      relationship with nature that is balanced and equitable.</div>

    <div class="annotation">Close reading the YA text, Endangered by Eliot Schrefer, Connors and Trites demonstrate the
      ways in which intersectionality plays a vital part in understanding larger, complex issues such as climate change.
      Connors and Trites use Endangered as a basis to demonstrate how climate change is an intersectional issue. The
      authors contend that to truly understand and reconcile our connection to nature, narratives should utilize a
      posthumanist perspective. Posthumanism challenges the inherently problematic binaries propagated by humanist
      beliefs. The authors consider how humanist perspectives separate humans from the rest of the world by depicting
      humans as superior, or more important than other species. Through their close reading of Endangered, Connors and
      Trites show the ways in which posthumanism allows the protagonist to question and challenge what is deemed human
      and what is not. This article will be helpful in showcasing the ways in which posthumanism and intersectionality
      is a necessary framework to tackle issues such as climate change.</div>

      <span class="title">“Peak Oil Imagining in Cormac McCarthy’s The Road and Paolo Bacigalupi’s <i>The Windup
        Girl</i>.”</span>
      <span class="remaining-citation"><i>English Academy Review </i>31.2 (2014): 156-169.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="annotation">This article explores the new trend of post-apocalypse, dystopian worlds depicted in
      speculative fiction which centralizes on the oil industry. Analyzing the The Road by Cormac McCarthy and The
      Windup Girl by Paolo Bacigalupi, Donnelly demonstrates the emerging fear of “petro-capitalism” and “the spatial
      violence” that it has enacted on the landscape of America. Donnelly examines how the novels comment on the effects
      of “petrotopia” in the post-apocalypse. He demonstrates how the post-petrol world reenacts the same capitalist and
      hegemonic rule over the nation. Moreover, these novels highlight the implications of our current dependence on
      petroleum and its connection to climate catastrophe. Donnelly contends that The Windup Girl rejects the idealistic
      notion “that the end of oil will necessitate social and political change,” and instead “indicates how
      neoliberalism might intensify rather than dissipate once oil is lost to the global economy, thereby maintaining
      both political corruption and American hegemony.” Similarly, The Road depicts the internalization of
      petro-capitalism through the father figure who resolutely continues to “perpetuate ‘the individual (male)
      breadwinner’s own entrepreneurialism’ as the basis of meaningful existence.” In both cases, Donnelly points out
      that the texts explore the inability to define petro-capitalism is the central problem that hinders the ability to
      imagine the end of capitalism. Moreover, Donnelly considers the implications of an essentialist narrative where
      accumulation and consumption of “resources as commodities” is a “fundamental dynamic of human organization”
      prevent any change in the systems that already exist. He argues that these essentialist beliefs place all
      accountability on human nature and neglects to consider systematic failures.</div>

    </div>
    <div class="annotation">Echterling showcases the ways in which children’s literature focuses on neoliberalistic
      individualism to tackle environmental issues. She draws out the implications of exposing children to such
      individualistic mindset, and how this takes away from tackling the complexity of climate change. Echterling
      acknowledges how YA dystopian literature indulges in complex conversations, but she focuses more on children’s
      literature which she claims has a more blatant pedagogical message. This article gives insight into the ways that
      children’s literature neglects tackling bigger issues such as consumerism and corporational accountability. As
      such, forms of activism taught by these books are too narrow and ultimately unhelpful. Using this article,
      arguments about how YA literature parallels or further delves into topics on climate change can be established.

      <span class="title">“An Increasingly Liberal Youth?: Political Ideologies in Young Adult Dystopian
        Literature.”</span>
      <span class="remaining-citation">https://www.american.edu/cas/literature/wsp/upload/2015-atrium.pdf</span>
    </div>
    <div class="annotation">Engle analyzes the political stance of the three novels, Divergent by Versonica Roth, The
      Hunger Games by Suzannne Collins, and The 5th Wave by Rick Yancey. She determines whether adult dystopian novels
      “may actually endorse certain political ideologies in teenagers,” and that young adult dystopian literature
      “convey[s] a liberal political ideology to teenagers.” Engle defines “conservatism” and “liberalism” in YA
      literature using a professor of Social Sciences, Brian Farmer’s, book American Political Ideologies as a
      foundation. She then examines the implications of YA novels increasing “levels of political engagement in
      teenagers and caus[ing] them to identify more heavily with the Democratic party.” According to Farmer,
      contemporary liberalism “has three major principles: a focus on government regulation of markets, increased
      personal liberties and decreased government surveillance, and a view that every person is intrinsically equal and
      should be treated as such.” Engle argues that these principles are evident in the three novels that she analyzes.
      In her analysis, Engle demonstrates how the depiction of the protagonists in each book “encourage the development
      of higher levels of general self-efficacy in teenages by providing models for development that teenagers can
      follow.” By modeling a narrative that promotes liberal ideologies, and modeling protagonists whose journeys
      develop their sense of self and self-identification, the novels encourage a greater identification to the
      Democratic Party in young readers and increases political engagement. Engle emphasizes the importance of political
      activism driven forth in young adults through YA literature. More significantly, she notes how these dystopian
      texts offer readers a sense of self-efficacy and political power that is not necessarily established elsewhere.
      Using her analysis, connections between low youth activism in regards to climate change can be supported.
      Analyzing the connection between YA protagonist’s activism for climate change and reader’s engagement in
      environmentalism might provide insight as to how conversations on climate change work, or can potentially work, in
      YA dystopias to motivate action in youth.</div>

    <div class="annotation">Outlining the history of the term ‘anthropocene’ and the genre of climate change, Goodbody

      demonstrate how intersectionality and styles of writings influence the way topics on climate change are received.
      Goodbody contends that experimentation with modes of writing and art can be especially beneficial to creating an
      impactful narrative that drives forth activism. For this research, Goodbody’s article provides a helpful timeline
      of the ways cli-fi has changed over the years, and how modern texts work better to establish close connections
      with readers on the topic of discussion. His analyses, especially, showcase how texts succeed in experimenting
      with style and disciplines, and narratives to focalize on climate change itself. Moreover, his analysis on why it
      is vital to include intersectional perspectives on the topic of climate change supports the ways in which the

      part in this oppression, and the political stance of the novel itself. Although the poster does not go too far in
      depth with the analyses, Green’s research does pose an interesting line of thought worth further investigating. By
      examining parental relations with the protagonist of female-centered stories, it would be interesting to see the
      ways in which themes of climate change are further complicated. How do parental figures, and parental absences
      (ie. dead father/mother figure) influence the relationship the protagonist has with nature? How does a female
      protagonist differ from a male protagonist on his or her journey towards tackling the issue of climate change?

      Hampton focuses on neoliberalism and climate change, as well as Marxism and climate change to show how it is
      presented academically. He then contends that by targeting trade unionships, conversations and understandings
      about climate change could be better mitigated, and determines that a democratic political and economic mindset is
      needed in order for this to occur. Hamptom also delves into various ways political beliefs of trade unions can be

    </div>
    <div class="annotation">Hursh and Henderson argue that neoliberalism has impeded the ability for us to create
      alternative futures. They discuess how “neoliberalism has not provided economic benefits, nor … has it responded
      adequately to environmental and educational issues,” and work to demonstrate “how it is that neoliberalism is
      largely uncontested so that we can challenge neoliberal discourses and practices.” Hursh and Henderson outline how
      neoliberalism has worked globally, using real-life examples to show how neoliberalism “has generally benefited the
      already privileged while harming most everyone else.” In this way, because of neoliberalistic agendas, climate
      change is not only largely ignored by the population, but it doesn’t even reach the level of educational awareness
      that it should within nations. Consequently, resolutions towards tackling climate change, or finding alternative
      lifestyles to slow its progression, remains unimaginable. Hursh and Henderson’s analysis of school systems is
      especially enlightening as it highlights how curriculums are “often reduced to a narrow skills approach,” which
      reduces students’ abilities “to respond to more complex, interdisciplinary questions.” Hursh and Henderson
      critique the implementation of standardized testing and privitization of school systems; they contend that by
      engaging students in questions about their worlds and the future that they imagine, as well as challenging the
      inevitability of neoliberal marketization can help “construct new markets that actually value commonly held
      resources and local communities.” Using this article, discourse on how YA novels are politically charged with
      neoliberalistic beliefs, and therefore skirt around topics of climate change can be examined. The article offers
      insight into the political landscape of climate change, and the implications of a neoliberal agenda. Its analysis
      on how education currently is implicated in neoliberal political perspectives emphasizes the way that
      neoliberalism pervades into younger generations. It advocates for a new, “social democratic approach” of learning,
      governing, and teaching that allows people to step outside of neoliberalist individualism and to imagine a better
      future.</div>

      Game by Monica Hughes, and Feed by M.T. Anderson, Hutton, Miller and Braithwaite demonstrate how the protagonists
      interact with utopian and dystopian technological states, and their respective relationships with nature and
      technology. They highlight how relationship with technology has also been a part in separating the body from
      nature. Hutton, Miller, and Braithwaite argue that “[n]ature and the artificial are frequently constructed as
      binaries that the young person must negotiate or resist in order to survive and preserve the future.” They
      demonstrate how environmental dystopias depict technology “as both the saviour of earth … and, more commonly,
      destroyer of the earth.” Young bodies in these narratives are arguably “intensive sites where the consequences of
      the loss of the natural environment can be brought into even sharper focus.” The article analyzes young bodies in
      the texts to show how they are vulnerable to the “salvation or destruction” of technology. It defines the
      relationship between technology, nature, and body as complex and interconnected; the blur between technology and
      the organic can become “a hazardous site not only for the formation of identity, but indeed, survival.” The
      article demonstrates the contradictory and complex nature of technology and environment in these dystopias,
      highlighting how the encroachment of artificial technology not only can lead to the “destruction or replacement of
      natural systems,” but is also needed for the survival of life. This article will be significant to determine how
      relationships with body, technology, and nature are depicted in YA dystopias. Hutton, Miller, and Braithwate’s
      readings offer insight on how technology severs and connects young bodies to nature, and the implications of such
      relationship. Moreover, through these readings, discussion as to how portrayal of body in nature, and outside of
      nature, and its implications in terms of climate change can be further explored.</div>

      fiction. It seeks to understand the relationship and implications of the child saviour motif in post-apocalypse.
      Through the readings of the Finnish YA fiction novels: De hemlösas stad (2010 [The City of the Homeless],
      untranslated) by Annika Luther, Jäljellä (2012 [Without a Trace, untranslated) and Toisaalla (2012 [Elsewhere],

      (2013 [Nettle Revolution], untranslated) by Siiri Enoranta, and Kevätuhrit (2016 [Spring Sacrifices],
      untranslated) by K. K. Alongi, the authors demonstrate how giving political subjectivity to young protagonists
      allows them the freedom to challenge, and to interact with larger institutions that will affect them throughout
      their lives. The authors claim that Finnish YA dystopia narratives “reveals collective fears over the destruction
      of the Finnish welfare state.” They note that hope typically presides in the potential change that the next
      generation can bring into the world. Analyzing Western YA dystopian novels, they note that “there is a long
      tradition of seeing childhoods itself as utopian, a space and time apart from adult life and all its concerns.”
      The authors, therefore, examine how giving young characters “strong active agency,” can bring hope to dystopian
      futures. Through close readings of the previously listed novels, the authors inquire as to how children are
      depicted in YA dystopias. They examine “the societal roles, freedom, societal power, and the agency of young
      characters” in each text. They then outline how “climate and ecological themes” work in these YA novels, as well
      as how fairytale tropes work with girlhood and female power. This article presents an international perspective on
      youth in YA dystopias. Using this article, it could be interesting to see the ways in which the protagonists in YA
      American novels are implicated through their political and social autonomy and obligations. Their section on
      ecology and political agency provides insight as to how youth form their identity within nature. Moreover, their
      readings demonstrate how depictions of youth can motivate political activism.</div>

    <div class="annotation">This article explores the gaps and “bright spots” in cli-fi novels that elicit hope and
      awareness amongst young readers. Through an analysis of Julie Bertagna’s Exodus trilogy, the authors work to
      understand the emotional and intellectual response that the novels evoke about climate change in young readers,
      and whether cli-fi is able to fulfill an interdisciplinary, educational experience for its audience. The authors
      utilize the terms, “blank spots,” and “bright spots,” introduced in an editorial by Alan Reid, which refers to
      areas in research about “the educational and the environmental” that “give rise to questions but not necessarily
      answers,” and topics of research that “inspire and innovate research.” The article seeks to determine the “blank
      spots” in cli-fi novels in hopes that it will lead to them becoming “bright spots.” Through a case study in which
      groups of students (10-12 years) were asked to investigate and reflect on “representations related to nature,
      climate change, and sustainability” in the trilogy, the authors utilize young voices to “[rethink] the role of
      literature in education.” Through their case-study, the authors confirmed that young readers “are likely to
      recognize themselves in” the protagonist and form their own identities and emotions related to climate change. The
      depiction of apocalypse and the depiction of human destruction also worked “as a call to action in the present.”
      The study found that education for sustainable development requires a more critical and intersectional
      understanding of economic, social, and cultural issues. Traditional methods of teaching, they argue, is not
      adequate in tackling complex socio-political issues, and hinder students’ abilities to recognize how it affects
      their current lives. Leavenworth and Manni highlight the importance of using YA texts in education, and the

      that the “nature/culture dualism is discussed in relation to another dualism, namely, that of utopia and
      dystopia.” Using an ecocritical lens, Lyngstad shows how the novels “link utopia to nature, especially the rural
      pastoral, and dystopia to culture, especially urbanism and technology.” The article offers a close reading of the
      two novels where she contrasts and compares the two different utopian/dystopian worlds (Zenith, a pastoral,

      possibility of being able to imagine a “non-violent and non-disastrous process” against the potential disaster.
      Disaster films and literature, she argues add an element of fantasy to the situation of climate change that is not
      conducive to encouraging social change. Readers and viewers get caught up in the underlying conspiracies causing
      the issue in the first place, which reduces the gravity of climate change in reality, or elicits anxiety, fear and
      defeatist mindsets. However, she argues that “transition stories” that focus on rebuilding worlds “in the midst of
      crisis” offer ideas for change that is socially and ecologically responsible. Analyzing texts such as the Parable
      novels by Octavia Butler and The Ministry for the Future by Kim Stanley, Mackenthun demonstrates how novels that
      are in the midst of ecological disaster, or transitioning into ecological disaster, present more opportunities to
      discuss preventative alternatives and solutions. Literature that depicts transition states offer a future that is
      not already set in stone, thereby allowing readers to imagine a future that has the potential to be changed and
      bettered. Mackenthum’s analysis presents the ways in which the texts frame ecological disaster and how characters
      work in a collaborative manner to alleviate the situation. Her sections on “Spirituality as a Source of Power,”
      and “Intellectual Resilience through Education” showcase how education, art, and spirituality are important
      elements of human survival. She offers an insightful close-reading of various YA cli-fi texts to show how and what

    </div>
    <div class="annotation">This article challenges the political undertones of the term “climate change” and how
      postcolonial backgrounds exclude local citizens from proposed solutions. Mikulewicz contends that the term climate
      change, similar to gender equality, is adapted to fit the agendas of businesses and politics. Using a case study
      on Sāo Tomé and Prıncipe (STP), this article outlines how adaption of the definition of climate change implicates
      the project to tackle climate change in the Global South. The case study works to show who is neglected and who
      the project benefits. It ultimately seeks to determine how climate change could be understood in a way that is
      advantageous to everyone. Mikulewicz considers the securitization of climate change, in which the definition
      adapted and became a global threat, provoking an increase in apocalyptic depictions of the impending end of the
      world. He considers the confliction in understanding climate change as “an imminent, global threat to humanity as
      a whole” while learning that it does not affect everyone equally. Sections on the term “discursive violence” and
      the implication of adaption emphasizes how vulnerable subjects are removed of their agency and disadvantaged by
      proposed solutions. Utilizing these analyses in YA literature might challenge the way climate change is not only
      being portrayed but how certain areas and groups that are marginalized in these fictional depictions are affected
      by the way the term has been defined. Furthermore, challenging the adaptions of the term climate change in YA

    <div class="annotation">This article works to understand the reason of denialism, neoliberalist agendas and its
      impact on climate change. Mirowski, Walker, and Abboud argue that the left is “paralyzed by climate change”
      because it has “conflated neoliberalism with neoclassical economics” and has used denialism as a way to finance
      the carbon cycle. The authors contend that by propagating geoengineering as the only other alternative to tackle
      the issue of climate change, neoliberal agendas have successfully benefited from the issue. The biggest conflation
      that Mirowski notes is between the market and nature. When nature fails, the left chalks it up to market failure,
      and this is the reason we are not seeing proper social activism against climate change. Understanding climate
      change in this way hinders us from asking questions that economics has no answer for. Neoliberalists believe that
      nature is incomprehensible and non-linear. They say that new markets must be formed in the face of market failure,
      and that the market knows the best course of action. This is why denialists stand against scientists who speak for
      the greater good, because neoliberalists believe that no human can understand the extent of climate change.
      Mirowski, Walker, and Abboud debunk neoliberal thought when they point out why carbon trading and geoengineering
      will not properly tackle the effects of climate change. The authors bring forth reasons as to how neoliberalist
      thought only benefits the market and the implications of how climate change is presented to the general
      population. They conclude by reconsidering what “economy” means and its role in climate change. The article
      contends that the best way to truly initiate social change is to look for policies outside of neoliberalist
      thought. This article critiques neoliberalist agenda when it comes to climate change. It talks about the
      implications of climate change being defined under neoliberalist perspective and how that can affect what is not
      being spoken about. When considering the gaps in climate change literature and the portrayal of climate change in
      YA literature, analyzing the politics of the term might determine why there is an absence.</div>

      Pirzadeh determines how YA dystopian novels incorporate the topic of environmentalism in a nuanced way that is
      still accessible to young readers. She explains how the two texts utilize “enlightened anthromorphism” which
      advocates for a nonexploitative relationship with the environment. Pirzadeh’s analysis discusses how YA literature
      can challenge traditional views on climate change and teach young populations of readers an alternative perception
      of their selves within nature. Moreover, it can help motivate them to form non-exploitative identities with
      nature. She highlights how “ecodystopian novels” are abundant platforms for raising awareness about the
      environment. Pirzadeh’s section on ecopolitics demonstrates the ways in which neoliberalist thought and capitalist
      agendas skew with our understanding of nature. Her analysis builds further on how politics influence YA narratives
      and how they are, in turn, affecting young readers. By teaching young readers to analyze text using an
      ecopolitical lens can help counteract the internalization of neoliberal influence. Furthermore, she contends,
      incorporating ecopolitics can teach young readers about the complexity and intersectionality of climate change.
      Utilizing ecodystopian novels will teach youth how to be aware of their own consumeristic habits as well as the

      “the young-survivor protagonists learn to adapt in the hard times,” by forming or reforming a relationship with
      nature. In her analysis, Setyorini examines the way nature is depicted in the narrative and the way it is
      perceived (and used) by the protagonist throughout his/her journey. She considers the portrayal of nature as a
      source of refuge and safety for the protagonist, and how the implementation of technology works with and in
      nature. Setyorini points out the ways in which adult, authoritative leaders use nature “as a force” wherein nature
      is “an antagonistic space,” which showcases how humanism separates the self from nature and its implications. On
      the contrary, her sections on the ways in which Katniss from The Hunger Games and Tris from Divergent form their
      identity through nature demonstrates shows how nature is also used as a space to reconcile and develop agency
      within female characters. It might be worth examining the implications of paralleling adolescent growth and female
      subjectivity to nature. Using her analysis, questions as to how youth is utilized to reforge a connection to
      nature, how youth can become the potential posthuman who redefines and shapes nature as nature shapes them, and
      the ways in which gender plays a part in its connection to nature can be further challenged.</div>

    </div>
    <div class="annotation">Sharp analyzes how law is used and transformed in dystopian fiction comics. She focuses on
      the comic series From Above by creator Craig Bruyn to demonstrate how the depiction of law and justice (and its
      failures) works in conjunction to current socio-political anxieties, and how law and justice also work to mediate
      these fears. In her analysis, she shows how the political collapse in the dystopian world in From Above not only
      warns readers of the consequences of real-life social crises but offers a narrative of hope. Sharp’s reading of
      the failure of the law and how it separates the people from the law can be generalized into how the law neglects
      or transforms terminologies like climate change as well. Her argument about how dystopian fiction provide a
      framework of hope which “offers significant transformative potential” can be used to support how YA literature
      presents a line of redemption and how that can evoke social change. Sharp’s readings on neoliberal law and how the
      narrative advocates for social change is particularly relevant to how neoliberalism alters understanding of
      climate change, and how it has systematically neglected to take the proper course of action needed to tackle the
      issue. Lastly, using her examination of the how themes of hope advocate for social change can be further
      considered in readings of YA fiction. How does a medium that does not include visuals promote social activism in
      readers? How does the depiction of the justice system in YA literature work and connect with climate change?
      Moreover, how can YA literature make the complex and nuanced relationship between law, justice, and climate change
      more accessible for its readers so that it is not only an institution that is feared and must be overthrown, but
      rather it offers an opportunity to be reshaped and redeemed?</div>

    <div class="annotation">Schneider-Mayerson timelines the history of cli-fi and climate change as it is represented
      in fiction throughout the years. He contends that cli-fi is a category rather than a genre on its own that depicts
      “the ongoing struggle to safeguard a livable climate for our species and millions of others,” and inspires readers
      to understand their own culpability in the matter. His section on denial, avoidism, and acceptance considers the
      importance of texts that portray the implications of denial and avoidance of climate change. Using examples of
      texts such as Carbon Dreams by Susan Gaines, Flight Behavior by Barbara Kingsolver, and State of Fear by Michael
      Crichton, Schneider-Mayerson examines how the “hybrid realism” of these texts showcase “the mediation of climate
      change through science and culture and its apperception through the intersectional categories of nationality,
      socioeconomic conditions, and ideology” (313). He then considers whether fiction is truly able to inspire
      collective political action for there to be any change. He argues that cli-fi post-apocalypse and dystopian
      fiction do not effectively inspire political action because readers are too familiar with apocalyptic tropes.
      Desensitization to the end of the world narratives make it easy for audience to ignore the content that is being
      challenged and pointed out. Finally, he examines texts such as The Earth Party by George Marshall, Daniel Kramb’s
      From Here, and Kim Stanley Robinson’s Science in the Capital sci-fi trilogy to show how texts that examine
      possible political frameworks to tackle climate change, or imagine futures that can be improved might actually
      motivate readers to become politically active. Schneider-Mayerson concludes by examining two emerging themes:
      transition to a life after oil, and climate injustice. This article is particularly helpful because it outlines
      texts that indulge in conversations about climate change. His section on eco-politics and the future of cli-fi is
      significant in determining the direction of future research on the subject. His conversation on the new emerging

      on climate change is hindering progress towards building a solution. He outlines how neoliberalist policies began
      and how neoliberal political parties have used connections to narrow their perception about climate change.
      Although the standpoint is no longer that climate change does not exist, neoliberalist have started branding
      climate change as an issue that human beings must and should adapt to. As such, political parties have formed a
      belief that the expenditure towards adaptation procedures should be prioritized over management or reduction
      procedures. This belief system just goes to show how neoliberalists have taken the relationship between the
      economy and market and transferred it to the relationship between humans and the biosphere. He argues that this
      line of thought disregards emotional connection to the environment and the effects it will have on lower-class
      citizens. Neoliberalist claims that climate change can be reversed through geoengineering or that adaptation
      (molding the world to fit our needs as climate change occurs) is a cheaper alternative, Shrubsole argues, is
      illogical. Shrubsole then offers an alternative perspective by pointing out how historically traditional
      conservative parties have voiced and acted on the need to protect the earth. He argues that highlighting this line
      of thought in which all people should work as a collective to finance and, at the very least, manage the effects
      of climate change, should be a priority. The government needs to push forward laws and policies that double down
      on corporational and industrial pollution as well as finance groups and parties that work to build infrastructure
      that will weather the changing environment. Shrubsole concludes that in order to fight climate change, hope is
      important, and that fatalism is only an excuse that prevents action. He reiterates that neoliberalism has clung to
      the wrong ideals and that following it will only further exacerbate the situation that we are already in. His
      article is particularly helpful in understanding neoliberalism and its influence on climate change. His arguments
      on alternative frameworks to tackle climate change can be helpful with determining how YA novels should portray a
      better present in their narratives that can avoid catastrophes in the future.</div>

    <div class="annotation">This article delves into the effects of neoliberal agendas on health and climate change.
      Sparke demonstrates how the roots of neoliberalism pits humans as “molecular frontiers for capitalist growth,” and
      how its political structure “materialize[s] as structural violence on the poor.” The section on how neoliberalism
      has adopted an “adaptive” political framework to tackle climate change offers insight into the complex way this
      also targets lower-class citizens. Sparke contends that through neoliberalist policies, issues such as climate
      change and health have become individualized which removes accountability from markets and businesses. He
      showcases how health and climate change are invariably interconnected. His example of factory farming, for
      instance, highlights the damaging approach of the mass-market not only for the climate, but also for the health of
      workers and animals. Sparkes’ article is an enlightening resource that lists real-world evidence of how
      neoliberalism is failing as a political structure. His explanation of how neoliberalism is sold globally offers
      great insight into the way neoliberalism controls all aspects of life including mortality. The article presents a
      foundational understanding of neoliberalism and the intersectional approach needed to understand climate change.
      The full book also presents in-depth analysis of the effects of neoliberalism on the world. Part IV on “Natures
      and Environments” will also be a considerably helpful resource to understand the hand neoliberalism has on the

        45.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="annotation">Spencer focuses on the term “Anthropocene” to examine the relation between human, non-human,
      and nature in climate fiction literature. She delves into the implication of humanist thought in which man
      (specifically, European men) were historically seen as superior to nature. The quest to conquer space in nature
      reinforced the separation between man and nature and resulted in the distinction between “natural history and
      human history,” which is no longer possible under the lens of the Anthropocene. Spencer outlines how present
      theories of nature and human co-existing in relation to one another has opened a new understanding about the
      world. Spencer then analyzes how YA literature has embodied a humanist perception when it reuses the hero trope in
      which one protagonist undergoes a series of obstacles and challenges, and ultimately succeeds in his/her goal. She
      discusses the implication of such humanist “truths” which, she argues, are evidently “limiting.” She contends that
      YA quest narratives reinforce humanist beliefs that separate human from nature or emphasize the distinction
      between human v. other binaries. Exploring and analyzing multiple texts such as The Raven cycle, Spencer
      demonstrates how this binary between human v nature takes away from current understanding of nature. She argues
      that YA literature that explores the Anthropocene offers a better understanding of our world. Viewing natural
      space as the Anthropocene reduces the human v nature binary into something more complex and relational to one
      another because it further connects the protagonist to the environmental space that he/she is in. Sparke comments
      that: “The depiction of relational space in the text’s primary worlds is important for suggesting the productive
      possibility of moving away from the dominant ontologies in response to the climate crisis.” Sparke then
      demonstrates the ways in which the Raven Cycle opens up room for interpretation and steps away from humanist
      perspectives when it includes multiple narratives and histories, strays away from the hero trope and rejects the
      portrayal of a single hero character. Nature is deemed unpredictable, untameable, and time is relational, further
      perpetuating the ideology that it will take a collective and collaborative approach to be a part of the
      Anthropocene.</div>

    <div class="annotation">In her analysis of The Carbon Diaries 2015 and 2017 by Saci Lloyd, Von Mossner demonstrates
      how themes of uptopian hope offer young readers the ability to imagine an ecotopian future. She claims that as a
      critical eco-dystopia, The Carbon Diaries demonstrates how “personal engagement and hard work, and bringing about
      a better world is a political process driven by hope and desire” (71). As such, these books are able to “warn
      young adult readers about the future while mobilizing them into action” (71). Von Mossner begins by outlining the
      contradiction inherent in YA post-apocalypse narratives. She considers the benefits and downfalls of including a
      hopeful ending in these narratives, and ultimately demonstrates how ambiguity of climate change in the
      post-apocalypse world offer readers the ability to experience and understand the responsibility that “rests in the
      hands of their generation” (73). Following the trajectory of protagonist, Laura’s, life, Von Mossner shows how the
      coming-of-age trope coincides with growing political activism. Although Laura initially began reluctant to partake
      in politics, ultimately, as is seen in the sequel, she realizes that her growth, identity and survival is
      interwoven with nature and the rest of the political world. In this way, Laura learns the importance of being a
      politically active figure. Von Mossner demonstrates how Laura’s journey can be internalized and mirrored by young

      intersectional topics such as class, race, politics and their relation to climate change helped students better
      understand the subject. Moreover, students were more able to connect the narratives to their own lives and
      reality. Conversations about the refugee crisis, treatment of the refugees, and the impact of climate change on
      nations worldwide further reinforced the gravity of the situation in their current environment. Webb demonstrates

    </div>
    <div class="annotation">This paper examines how climate change has affected migration, specifically from Mexico. It
      considers the term “climate refugee” and what it does to the portrayal of people who are displaced from their
      homes due to climate changes. Wilson then analyzes how neoliberalism has exacerbated and targeted lower economic
      nations and peoples, such as small farmers in Mexico. Cross-analyzing various studies, Wilson demonstrates how
      countries like Mexico face a “double exposure” where “small farmers in the South are subjected [to] climate change
      and the pressures of globalization (including neoliberalism and structural adjustment).” The first and second
      sections of this article focus on how climate change and “stresses of neoliberal globalization” affect small
      farmers and drought-stricken areas of Mexico. The third section, then delves into the role of neoliberalism in
      “promo[ting] climate change.” Wilson examines how neoliberal agendas plays a large part in exacerbating climate
      change migration by inadvertently targeting vulnerable people. This article delves into the circular relationship
      between socioeconomic downfall caused by climate change, and the lack of protection of poor communities. Wilson
      highlights how people in the poorer nations are often neglected in neoliberal agendas and outlines what the
      effects of such systematic exclusions are. The article also discusses why and how neoliberalism propagates
      behaviour that magnifies climate change. Her findings can be especially useful in determining how climate change
      is depicted in YA literature. Wilson’s analysis showcases the intersectionality of climate change and the politics
      that influence potential preventative strategies to alleviate the issue. By demonstrating how certain groups are
      also politically targeted she also raises a vital question that considers how our current understanding of climate

    </div>
    <div class="annotation">This article talks about the colonization of the Anthropocene and the neglect of topics of
      race in post-apocalypse literature. Xausa contends that “literary representations of climate change can be
      complicit in producing hegemonic strands of Anthropocene discourse … de-emphasizing moral responsibilities” (88).
      Through her analysis of The Marrow Thieves by Cherie Dimaline, Xausa argues that the novel casts “a new light on
      the relationship between climate change, colonial and neo-colonial violence and structural inequalities generated
      by intersecting systems of oppression” and “amplifies the marginalized and forgotten experiences of those who are
      already experiencing the climate apocalypse” (81). In her analysis, Xausa highlights how the novel makes clear
      that the ecological crisis is not simply “a hostile nature … retaliating against human beings” but is instead a
      “neocolonistic and capitalistic logic” that turns “habitats, environments and bodies into resources to be
      subjugated, transformed and exploited” (93). She demonstrates how the narrative connects the present dystopian
      world to the past exploitation of Indigenous lands and peoples, which emphasizes the circular relationship of
      “past and current traumas” (94). In this way, Xausa argues that the novel shows how the past is not only repeating
      itself but is fundamentally interwoven with what is occurring currently in politics regarding climate change. She
      considers the threat of slow violence and the impact of climate change on people who have already lost lands,
      languages, and culture. Ultimately, Xausa determines how this survival story sheds light on the marginalized and

    <div class="annotation">In a collection of essays, this book works to see how YA dystopian and post-apocalypse
      novels are both a source of education and escape for young readers. The essays discuss how the genres “teach
      serious lessons about the issues faced by humanity, and [offer] readers a pleasurable retreat from their quotidian
      experience" (5). Basu, Broad, and Hintz’ essay focuses on dystopian fiction and identity politics. Through her
      analysis of Divergent by Veronica Roth, and Curse Workers Series by Holly Black, the authors work to examine the
      significance of an “essential self” and the ways in which politics inhibits it. The following sections then focus
      on body surveillance and space, and how that works with developing identity. Von Mossner and Baccolini’s essay in

    <div class="annotation">This book defines dystopia and post-apocalypse internationally, showcasing the way the term
      changes from nation to nation. The text delves into the colonial and capitalistic histories that influence the
      depiction of post-apocalypse and dystopian worlds. Sections including: “The Cultural Logic of Post-Capitalism:
      Cormac McCarthy’s The Road and Popular Dystopia” by Carl F. Miller, “The Dystopia of the Obsolete”: Lisa
      Robertson’s Vancouver and the Poetics of Nostalgia” by Paul Stephens, “Post-Frontier and Re-Definition of Space in
      Tropic of Orange” by Hande Tekdemir, and “Our Posthuman Adolescence: Dystopia, Information Technologies, and the
      Construction of Subjectivity in M.T. Anderson’s Feed” by Richard Gooding, tackle concepts most relevant to climate
      change, nature, and identity in dystopias and post-apocalypse fiction. Gooding’s chapter examines the “difficulty
      of reconciling dystopian pessimism with the traditional hopefulness” of dystopian fiction in M.T. Anderson’s Feed.
      His close reading of the novel demonstrates how environment, nature, and technology influences the protagonist’s
      identity and subjectivity. Stephen’s chapter analyzes Lisa Robertson’s poetry and prose to see the ways in which
      space, nature, and history defines identity. He explores how Robertson uses space to critique “the political
      mechanisms of capitalist society” and to “resituate [women] historically” by engaging in practices of nostalgia
      and obsolescence (252). Miller’s chapter analyzes The Road by Cormac McCarthy and argues that the novel’s
      “depiction of post-capitalism and the loss of a global economy results in a hyper-localized and hopelessly
      fragmented notion of humanity. In such a way, The Road provides a striking theoretical commentary on the legacy of
      capitalism and projects an overwhelmingly dystopian view of the loss of popular and consumer culture” (161). The
      chapter focuses on “whether history can survive the inverse triumph of nature of modernization” (198). The book
      offers multiple close readings of texts that examine human relationship with nature, the posthuman and adolescent
      identity, as well as the influence of capitalism and post-capitalism in imagined futures.</div>

      (2015) by Margaret Atwood, The Feed (2002) by M.T. Anderson, Cloud Atlas (2004) by David Mitchell and Never Let Me
      Go (2005) by Kazuo Ishiguro to show how neoliberal network power inhibits any course of action against systematic
      oppression. She presents the ways in which neoliberal beliefs are internalized by society which, in turn, prevents
      people from even understanding the extent to their powerlessness. As such, the motivation to rebel is drastically
      reduced. In her analyses, Gonnerman shows how neoliberal capitalism removes the possibility of being able to hope
      or imagine utopia which is seen in narratives that can imagine “the end of the world, the total destruction of the
      human race, yet not of an alternative to free market capitalism” (67). She contends that because of neoliberal
      network power, which is “a peculiar mix of individual agency and systemic coercion” there is no single figurehead
      or group to rebel against, which is why characters in the selected texts do not even fathom revolutionary action
      (72). Gonnerman’s book offers an in-depth look into the political, specifically neoliberal schema, evident in
      literature that prevents revolution or rebellions from occurring. She showcases how neoliberal policies can
      immobilize a group of people and placate them in treacherous and unjust situations. Using her readings, it would

    </div>
    <div class="annotation">Harrison’s book delves into the posthuman perspective in dystopian YA fiction. Harrison
      examines the relationship with human and nature, highlighting how the humanist perspective severs human connection
      with nature. Through her analysis of texts such as Unwind by Neal Shusterman or The Dead-Tossed Waves by Carrie
      Ryan, amongst many others, Harrison shows how dystopian environments are depicted as wild and foreign, thereby
      depicting the human body as incompatible with such environments. She examines the consequence of such severance
      and what the posthumanism has to offer. Chapters one to five explore the posthuman and its relation to climate
      change and environment. These chapters examine texts that entirely neglect or partially include concepts of
      posthumanism. In her analysis of Unwind by Neal Shusterman, she shows how “by mapping the effects of consumer
      culture directly onto the human body, the humanist hero of neoliberal capitalism is revealed as nothing more than
      a marketing ploy which, if undermined, might give way to more sustainable communities based on collective
      empowerment” (68). Her final two chapters move onto discuss narratives that follow non-linear narratives, and
      entirely embrace the posthuman perspective. These analyses can be helpful in demonstrating the ways in which YA
      novels present climate change, or relationships between nature and human. Harrison’s work demonstrates how YA
      fiction offer “complex agendas and ideologies” that challenge humanist systems and imagine “posthuman
      possibilities” (119). She argues that YA fiction offers readers to think critically about their “social
      responsibility, and the consequences of their own and others’ actions” (119). Moreover, these novels offer young
      readers to imagine a better future for themselves by teaching them the hostility of their current environment and

    <div class="annotation">Heidi’s book explores the way art, opera, and music discuss themes of climate change.
      Analyzing compositions such as Mozart’s Requiem, along with other soundtracks for nature documentaries, or opera’s
      such as “Persephone in the Late Anthropocene,” Heidi outlines the ways in which sounds and silence work to
      highlight the issue of climate change. The chapter on Persephone seems to be an especially interesting piece that
      examines the way absences work to connect with audiences. Sections about Anselm Kiefer who uses myth of Persephone
      to depict preservation of “earth as a damaged artifact” through art, or analysis on how the songless opera
      emphasizes the urgency and prevalence of climate change opens up an interesting conversation on how
      experimentation and multimedia pieces can better spread the message. Heidi’s examination of the “hyperobject”
      which is something that “eludes easy definition and response” and her analysis of “Writing of the Disaster” is the
      most relevant to our research on climate change. Using her finding, it would be interesting to see how YA
      literature experiments, or could experiment, with the physical form of storytelling to make its point more
      explicitly on climate change. Similarly, it might be interesting to focus on the absences in YA novels to see how
      they embody the “hyperobject.” Lastly, her readings of the posthuman in these artworks can be helpful to build on
      the idea of how climate change should be read and analyzed in texts.</div>

      2016.
    </div>
    <div class="annotation">Mehnert examines the effects of sci-fi and the necessity of imagination to understand
      climate change. She notices how “there is no transnational institution that deals with issues related to climate
      change on a global scale.” Mehnert points at the accountability placed on individuals and argues that
      individuality and small local movements, although helpful, “prevent us from envisioning alternative perspectives”
      that can take place on a global scale. Using current examples, Mehnnert demonstrates the elusiveness of the
      definition of climate change, and how that has added to the inability to properly tackle it. Mehnert argues that
      even science itself has a realm of fiction because of how elusive climate change is which has led to the bigger
      dilemma of discerning what is real or not, rather than imagining possible solutions. As such, Mehnert advocates
      for the importance of using sci-fi as a tool to better understand climate change. Analyzing the German text,
      Maeva! by Dirk C. Fleck, Mehnert demonstrates how his journalistic writing style and worlds that closely resemble
      real-life enhances readers’ connection to climate change. Fleck offers a text that encourages readers to find
      solutions towards the impending environmental catastrophe by forming “an environmental world citizenship.”
      Mehnert’s analysis draws out the way Fleck’s text pushes forth a solution that works to connect everyone globally,

      Parr, Adrian. The Wrath of Capital: Neoliberalism and Climate Change Politics. Columbia University Press, 2014.
    </div>
    <div class="annotation">Parr discusses the ways in which climate change has become politicized and neoliberalized.
      She talks about how understanding climate change using a neoliberal perspective affects and inhibits social
      change. She presents the ways neoliberal agendas influence consumption, diets, and media portrayal of climate
      change and how this impacts preventative action from being taken. Parr’s book demonstrates how neoliberalist
      strategies to solve climate change are only “distractions” while in reality “what persists is the condition of
      violence embedded in neoliberal capitalism as it robs each and every one of us (other species and ecosystems
      included) of a future.” Chapters one and two work to show how carbon markets and ulterior motives of neoliberal
      agendas fail to actually tackle the issue of climate change and instead, further exacerbate the situation. Chapter
      three highlights how the politicized and neoliberal climate change exploits women and vulnerable people. Chapter
      eight delves into the oil industry and the shortcomings of dealing with oil spills. She considers the ecological
      disasters caused by these oil spills, and how it is necessary to reconfigure the ways in which we treat failures.
      Parr warns about the potential degradation of the world if solutions towards climate change remain the same. Her
      work can be used to determine how YA fiction represents ecological disaster and the implications of the methods
      advocated to tackle it. Parr’s book offers an intersectional analysis of climate change that can be used to
      explain why there is a large gap in the literature on topics of climate change. Furthermore, her insights on the
      influences of neoliberalist politics can help with understanding how they work in narratives on youth and social
      activism.</div>

      Swyngedouw, Erik. Promises of the Political: Insurgent Cities in a Post-Political Environment. MIT Press, 2018.
    </div>
    <div class="annotation">This book interrogates the political structures and failures in the Western world and
      considers potential frameworks for a post-political environment. Swyngedouw considers how moves towards
      depolitization, or the reconfiguration of democracies, have emerged. He demonstrates how the growing
      disenchantment with Western democracies is leading to revolts that fight for depoliticization, and how
      post-politicization “ensures that the framework of debate and decision making does not question or disrupt the
      existing state of the neoliberal political-economic configuration.” The key question that he asks is, whether “and
      how progressive and emancipatory politics can still be thought and practiced in the twentyfirst century.” The book
      resides its argument on the two images of “the city” and “nature” to depict the postdemocratic modes of
      governance. The book begins by demonstrating how neoliberal politics has resulted in “the disappearance of the
      urban qua “polis.” It then outlines the history of post-politicization and orients readers on “the
      socio-ecological predicament the world is in.” The second part of the book focuses on the political perceptions of
      ‘nature,’ and how it functions in the process of depoliticization. Moreover, the second part of the book focuses
      on the political negligence on topics of climate change. Finally, the book considers the role of rebellions and
      revolts to repoliticize urban life and suggests political frameworks that could potentially reconfigure
      democracies into systems that are “progressive and emancipatory.” Chapters 4, 5, and 6, in particular, focus on
      ecological roles in politics, and climate change in the post-political world. For instance, in chapter 4,
      Swygnedouw examines the paradox in our understanding of nature. He highlights how politics have divulged two
      potential treatments of nature: one, in which nature is “predicated upon feverishly developing new natures …
      forcing nature to act in a way we deem sustainable or socially necessary,” while, two, also understanding that in
      order for survival, nature must be returned “to a presumably more benign condition” (65). He then contends that
      the term ‘nature’ itself is politicized and ambiguous and considers the implications of using such term. Chapters
      on climate change and environment offer political insight into the ways sustainability contradicts itself, the
      issue with ‘nature’ in politics, and potential reframing of the issue to rectify or, at the very least, narrow and
      form a coexisting space to understand rebuild a better, more inclusive political structure.</div>

    <div class="annotation">Blouin begins his book by considering the ways in which neoliberal agendas inhibit progress
      from preventing climate change. Chapter 8 focuses on how neoliberalism has formed a “dissonance” between the need
      for collective action, and “absolute freedom” (205). Using Foucault’s theory on “neoliberal schematics,” Blouin
      outlines how in the wake “against fascism” members of the school of thought “idolize[d] free thinkers that remain
      skeptical of solidarity movements,” and as such collectivism became a common antagonist (206). In the move to
      define neoliberalism, the term itself became ambiguous and convoluted. To this day, confusion surrounding the term
      has resulted in a conflict in agendas. In his analysis of The Hunger Games, Blouin shows how the trilogy “upholds
      a neoliberal framework under the illusion of its destruction” (208). He argues that her political journey is only
      a symptom of neoliberalist ideologies. He considers the implications of depicting such a government and highlights
      the importance of Katniss’ decision to advocate for a more holistic approach. Blouin contends that her seemingly
      utopian decision that acknowledges “[g]overnments will never solve the problem of power; a different kind of
      social arrangement must emerge,” does not separate her from neoliberal thought (210). In fact, he goes on to
      demonstrate how her decision reinforces individualist freedom that falls in line with neoliberalism instead of
      offering a collectivist solution, or an alternative framework for the future. Chapter five also argues how
      economics and politics undermine conversation about climate change through “greenwashing.” As such, Hollywood
      depictions of climate change are often romanticized, and serious conversation about it is swept under the rug.
      Blouin contends that the only way to target the issue is to be able to discuss the issue; unless media and
      literature open dialogue about climate change as it is, awareness will not improve. Blouin’s work offers a reason
      as to why texts sideline topics of climate change. His research can be helpful in establishing the political
      underbelly of climate change, and the parasitic nature of neoliberalism.</div>

    <div class="annotation">In this chapter, Bull, Byrne, and Dupuis outline the benefits of incorporating YA fiction
      texts interdisciplinarily in schools. They argue that by using YA literature in different disciplines as a
      learning tool can better accommodate “reluctant readers” by exposing them to relevant texts and narratives that
      interest them. Not only will this increase learning but will also allow students to use critical thinking skills
      in a wide variety of topics, including science. Section 2 of their chapter focuses on environmentalism and the
      importance of curating a curriculum that connect interdisciplinary concepts to each other and to students’ lives.
      This section demonstrates how a text can be used to teach both the language arts and science so that students are
      able to receive a multimodal form of learning and deeper understanding of the topic. The authors draw out a
      framework using Ship Breaker by Paolo Bacigalupi as an example of how a potential curriculum could look. They
      focus on questions that broaden students’ understanding and motivation to learn further about the subject. This
      text will be particularly helpful in providing insights as to how using YA apocalypse novels to discuss topics of
      climate change and environmentalism will be beneficial in an academic setting. Using fiction narratives to teach
      students about real life problems can help target the very impending issue about climate change.</div>

      stereotypes are reinforced in these narratives. This article presents two supporting arguments that can be used to
      build on research about the topic of climate change in YA fiction. The first argument: excluding conversations on
      race in YA narratives coincides with the way climate change is also largely ignored. Couzelis showcases how
      remnants of racial and individualistic bias (the humanist perspective) in politics has influenced what
      conversations on climate change look like. Secondly, the article also highlights how biases against race
      inadvertently magnify issues of race itself. By refusing to acknowledge race in narratives, racial minorities
      remain othered, and their issues are received with skepticism and cynicism. Couzelis’ article asserts the
      importance of viewing climate change using an intersectional lens and considering the impacts of race in

    </div>
    <div class="annotation">Gaard pushes forth an intersectional lens when viewing climate change in fiction literature.
      She talks about how narratives leave out certain disciplines, including race, gender, and sexuality, and how this
      exclusion has affected the public opinion in their understanding of the subject, and how it influences policy
      making. She proposes that by “bringing a critical ecofeminist standpoint … to illuminate the strengths and
      shortcomings of literary narratives that present the problem of climate change from a (masculinist)
      technological-scientific perspective” will give a more “complete restor(y)ing of climate change causes and
      effects” (169). She hopes that by doing so will lead to a “greater potential to shape and contribute to activist
      and policy-making discourses around climate justice” (169-70). Gaard presents readers with a short list of texts
      that fall short or exemplify ecofeminist lens in their depiction of climate change. She examines the implications
      of leaving out an ecofeminist perspective from analysis of texts, and how it influences public understanding and
      opinion on the matter. Her section on children’s and YA climate change, in particular, focus on the potential to
      empower and teach youth about the subject and motivate them towards ecosocial change. Yet, she notices that even
      in this children’s literature, narratives offer only a narrowed lens on climate change that reinforces masculinist
      technocratic perspectives and are influenced heavy by neoliberal capitalist agendas. Interestingly YA dystopian
      literature presents young readers with a realist, intersectional understanding of climate change, as is seen in
      The Carbon Diaries by Saci Lloyd, or The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, amongst others. In these novels,
      narratives are written in the perspective of a growingly empowered female protagonist who must speak up against
      injustices. Using her readings on YA dystopian novels, the value of the genre in academic settings, as well as
      determining how its presentation on climate change can influence and further open up the definition of the
      environment would be vital. Moreover, Gaard’s readings offer insight into the importance YA dystopian literature
      in configuring an alternative mode of thinking and political structure for a better, imagined future.</div>

    <div class="annotation">Alice Curry argues that the relationship between human and nature as demonstrated in YA
      fiction can help pave the way to a better understanding of the environment. Using an ecopoeisis lens to analyze
      the texts Shadows Cast by Stars and The Interrogation of Ashala Wolf, she highlights the ways the relationship
      between nature and human has been severed, and how this severance is later reconciled in the post-apocalypse. The
      two narratives offer a “voice” to “nature’s self-realization,” and in this way question the type of relationship
      that we hold with nature currently. The characters in the novels, for instance, develop two forms of
      relationships, one being the humanist connection where nature is separate from human, and the other being
      posthuman connection where nature and human are mutually connected to each other. Curry contends that the
      posthuman is the solution to better understanding and recreating a connection with and to nature. Moreover, she
      demonstrates how posthumanist perspectives in two narratives work to resist against colonialism and climate
      change. Curry’s analysis on the posthuman body and the ways it interacts with nature outlines how narratives can
      tackle against climate change by imagining a reconnection to nature that is balanced and interconnected with the
      human body. More specifically, her analysis demonstrates how YA narratives can be taught to students so that they
      can learn to question humanist beliefs prevalent in current politics, and to redefine their own relationship to
      nature.</div>

    <div class="annotation">Deininger and Scammell explore the ways that ecofeminism works in Louise Lawrence’s YA short
      fiction stories. They contend that ecofeminism is a significant part of understanding the politics of climate
      change, and demonstrate the ways in which the female body works in parallel to the depiction of climate change.
      Through their analysis, they argue that the oppression of the post-apocalyptic environment parallels that of the
      female population. Freeing the plants and the flowers fall in line with the way women seek power. In this way,
      tackling issues of climate change not only intersects with feminism, but also highlights issues of feminism that
      need to be considered. Deininger and Scammell’s analysis emphasize the intersectionality of climate change, and
      how it is not simply its own individual issue. Utilizing an ecofeminist lens to discuss climate change can
      establish a helpful foundation to discuss the complicated relationship between climate change and feminism.
      Understanding the connection between nature and the female body can give insight towards ways that narratives can

      the “simulated ecology” in virtual games (53). Focusing specifically on the graphic novel by Cory Doctorow and Jen
      Wang, In Real Life, Anastasia Salter analyzes the way nature is separated from the main character, Anda. Salter
      demonstrates how “[t]he relationship of players with the virtual world is likewise one of ownership of space”
      (53). She then, through close-readings, shows how the authors challenge and “reject digital utopianism” by using a
      “multiplayer online-role-playing game as context for interrogating digital avatars as actors within a
      virtualphysical environment space” (54). Salter delves into conversation about the binary of real world/digital
      world, or natural ecology/ digital ecology, and shows how the lines between the two may not be as separate as is
      believed. She posits that the role of imagination, and the blurring of person and their respective avatar “provide
      an entrypoint into a larger conversation of the impact of play on the perception of responsibility and involvement
      with an environment” (54). Salter, then, discusses how In Real Life offers an intersectional approach to its
      narrative, and how this can be utilized in ecofeminist and ecocritical analysis. Her readings bring to focus the
      ways in which narratives depict environments and how that plays into the depiction of its characters. Moreover,

    </div>
    <div class="annotation">This chapter delves into the way climate change is incorporated into Lloyd’ Saci’s The
      Carbon Diaries, and how Lloyd’s portrayal of ecological disaster encourages political action on behalf of young
      readers. The chapter considers how the genre of eco-dystopia offers outlooks into potential alternatives and
      solutions that can help prevent the effects of climate change, or at the very least, alter the consequence of
      climate change in the present world. The author argues that it is both a combination of hope and desire that is
      necessary in dystopian literature: “The young readers expects—and needs—stories that are gripping but nevertheless
      offer at least a promise that a better world will be possible.” Mossner then demonstrates how Lloyd incorporates
      both elements (hope and desire) in The Carbon Diaries through the depiction of ecological catastrophe. She argues
      that the novel is a “critical eco-dystopia” which blends utopian elements of hope and desire into dystopian
      science fiction. The chapter then contends that “critical dystopian texts articulate a specific political agency
      not only on the level of the narrative but also in terms of the reader’s relationship to the world, because they
      open up a possibility for … ‘radical hope.’” Although the novel presents a dystopian world that eerily mimics
      present-day situations, Lloyd also brings in a theme of hope to advocate for a potentially better future. This
      chapter, and book, contains a few chapters such as “Educating Desire,” or “Dystopian Sacrifice” amongst others
      which consider the benefits and disadvantages of eco-dystopias, and cli-fi. Chapters on the posthuman and this one
      offer insight into the ways in which themes of hope can open dialogue for solutions for a better imagined future.

    <div class="annotation">This chapter examines the relationship between female protagonists’ character awakening and
      nature. McDonoguh and Wagner argue that there is a symbiotic relationship between female characters and nature in
      which a female character gains her agency through her experiences with nature. She is both shaped by nature and
      simultaneously shaping nature in order to claim her agency. The authors analyze three novels: Uglies by Scott
      Westerfield, Matched by Ally Condie, and Delirium by Lauren Oliver to show how female agency and identity is
      formed through and within nature. Using an ecofeminist lens, the authors discuss how the return to nature “is
      exhibited through the unique opportunities in nature each female protagonist must face.” These opportunities
      include “growing up, falling in love, and learning about herself,” which occurs once the female protagonist leaves
      the safety of her home and interacts with nature. Through close-readings of each text, McDonough and Wagner
      demonstrate how “[t]he process of awakening occurs” through the protagonists’ realization of her own actions upon
      the world and “conclude with newly empowered female protagonists willing to claim their agency and act.” The
      chapter outlines the importance of reading texts using an ecofeminist lens, and how through this relationship
      offers room to restructure “understandings of both gender and nature within a larger culture framework.” The
      chapter, and book, presents examines female identity and rebellion in dystopian fiction. Each chapter deconstructs
      and analyzes how female bodies work within dystopian narratives, and what female rebellion can look like. It might
      be interesting to examine the relationship of female identity and nature, and how that plays a part in discussion
      on climate change. How does the depiction of female agency and nature work to create a close connection between
      readers and nature? What are the implications of paralleling female identity to nature and our understanding of

      against political and capitalist structures, and the effects of such movement. Sections on who YA literature is
      targeting (adults as opposed to children), as well as the benefits of teaching young children about political
      realities through fictional narratives is especially relevant to discussion on the importance of YA literature and
      climate change. The effects of The Hunger Games on real-world political climates demonstrates how YA literature
      can be used as a way to comment and actively engage with politics. Furthermore, analysis on real-world revolts
      propelled by pop-media such as V for Vendetta as well as The Hunger Games reiterates the significance of the genre
      in shaping political landscapes globally. McEvoy-Levy also considers the consequences of what The Hunger Games
      does not talk about, such as race, and the implications of having such a gap in a narrative that took the world by
      a storm. His discussion on the exploitation of the narrative through toys and fan-franchises also opens up a new
      line of thought in terms of how revolt from pop-culture can also benefit capitalist structures by allowing them to

    <div class="annotation">Thompson’s chapter contends that ‘home’ for protagonists in YA dystopian narratives
      challenge the 19th century depiction of the term, and that ‘home’ extends beyond physical space. Using the two
      novels, Unwind by Neal Shusterman (2007) and Ready Player One by Ernest Cline (2011), Thompson demonstrates how
      defining a home space is vital for YA protagonists to form their identity and sense of subjectivity. She claims
      that YA “narratives suggest what a young protagonist needs is to recognize that a true home or sanctuary is
      created for oneself, based on one’s self-acceptance and experiences of places and people” (228). Sections on
      virtual space and reality, as well as spaces such as the Graveyard as a source of autonomy plays an interesting
      role in the depiction of nature. Although Thompson does not explicitly discuss topics of climate change or nature,
      her analysis on the ways in which Connor and Wade’s homelessness and rebuilding of homes can be used to build
      arguments on how nature and character agency works to define youth identity. It would be interesting to consider
      how different natures (virtual reality, the “hyperreal,” v. urban neighbourhoods, impoverished neighbourhoods)
      define agency and reality, as well as the relationship between control and autonomy for young characters.</div>

    <div class="annotation">In this interview, Stephanie LeManger delves into the importance of cli-fi, and its
      influence in mainstream social activism and awareness. She discusses how cli-fi in pop culture in particular has
      opened conversation in the mainstream as well as academia about issues on climate change. LeManger contends that
      the inclusion of cli-fi in academia and mainstream has demonstrated the impact that fiction literature has on
      social change, advocating for or against political climates, and mediating social crises. She claims that cli-fi
      novels and films is a “gateway” towards social action. LeManger considers the absences evident in cli-fi
      literature, as well as our understanding of posthumanism (and the exclusion of Indigenous philosophies). She
      argues that “academic writing … is also a form of vitality … [and] that it is social action.” The interview
      tackles the process of writing, reading dystopian texts. It gives insight into the ways in which academica can be
      utilized as a form for social activism, and the importance of using these texts to better educate the general
      population.</div>

      Chattopadhyay, Bodhisattva. “Apocalyptic Projections: A Study of Past Predictions, Current Trends and Future
      Intimations as Related to Film and Literature." (2017): 129-132.
    </div>
    <div class="annotation">Chattopadhyay’s review of “Apocalyptic Projections: A Study of Past Predictions, Current
      Trends and Future Intimations as Related to Film and Literature” focuses on how the author, Anette Magid, outlines
      the freedom that YA apocalypse fiction offers for imagining alternative futures. Although this article is not
      directly connected to the topic of climate change, it does provide an alternative intersectional framework that
      can be used to examine reasons and potential resolutions for the issue. For instance, Magid’s analysis of culture
      and eugenics (or definition of what it means to be human) can be used to examine the ways in which the posthuman
      might play a part in understanding issues of climate change. Essays such as Julian Cornell’s “Getting the Doomsday
      We Deserve: Rolan Emmerich’s 2012 and the Neoliberal Disaster Film” provide an “ambitious … attempt to couple
      themes of climate change disaster film with eroding American economic hegemony.” This essay focuses on how “the
      American disaster film is inherently conservative, even when it invokes the wider globe,” which “provides a useful
      if indirect insight into the changing face of sf as a genre.” Essays within the book offer insight into the issues
      of Western monopolies on media and narrative portrayals of the post-apocalypse, and what a potential global
      approach could look like. Chattopadhyay emphasizes that the “collection could have worked better with a reduced
      selection” but will still “make a useful companion for courses on apocalypses and dystopias.” As such, Magid’s
      collection of essays provide a useful foundation with various perspectives to understand the complex nature of YA
      narratives.</div>

    </div>
    <div class="annotation">Donawerth’s review of Octavia Butler’s conversation on writing science fiction gives insight
      into how the genre was used to drive forth social reform. In the collection of interviews with Octavia Butler, the
      book “offers a good overview of the inconsistencies in Butler’s representation of herself.” Although Donaweth
      laments that the book is not organized chronologically and does not include oral interviews with Butler, it is
      still a great resource to understand Butler’s writing process. The collection gives insight as to how she uses
      multiple disciplines and targets multiple audiences to acknowledge and act against social injustices. Butler
      believes “that she views novels as ‘preaching’” and that through her novels, she can reform the human race from
      its “destructive biological urges.” Interviews on texts such as Kindred, or The Parable of the Sower, for
      instance, offer insight into how and why Butler chose to represent race, gender, and climate change the way that
      she did in her narratives. Understanding her intent and use of the sf genre to motivate change and action will
      better connect readers to the importance of narratives in terms of political action.</div>

      <span class="remaining-citation">Children’s Literature Association Quarterly 45.2 (2020): 186-189.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="annotation">Gooding’s review on Jennifer Harrison’s text gives an in-depth analysis of her book. He
      summarizes that Harrison argues how “humanism’s main task is to perform boundary work that protects the social
      order” by keeping the environment separate from the individual, and society. Harrison analyzes various texts,
      including Forest of Hand’s and Teeth by Carrie Ryan, and The Giver by Lois Lowry, to examine how images of
      zombies, and dystopias utilize the depiction of “hostile, threatening, and separate” environments by creating
      narratives and characters that “breach … the boundary between the human and the environment,” and destroy the
      social order of humanist societies. Harrison uses these texts to showcase how they adhere “to humanist values” and
      the implications of such adherence. Gooding, then, discusses Harrison’s second chapter which examines texts that
      are more open to post-humanist narratives. He demonstrates how novels such as Unwind by Neal Shusterman move
      towards a partial “posthuman ethic,” where it rejects neoliberal systems and humanist perspectives while it also
      “affirms the value of the humanist subject within the structures of contemporary capitalism.” Harrison’s final two
      chapters “examine dystopias that embrace the posthuman state by erasing the nature/culture divide and moving
      beyond conventional narratives of identity formation.” According to Gooding, chapter six in particular offers a
      “careful analysis of visual elements” in the graphic novel Decelerate Blue, and “contains some of the most
      satisfying moments” in her book. Although Gooding deems Harrison’s book “frustrating” at times because of its
      “tendency to buttress claims with lengthy literature reviews” and its carelessness with copyediting, he does
      acknowledge that Harrison’s work provides a “compelling argument.” This review is helpful because it does pull out
      certain arguments from Harrison’s text that would be especially prevalent for research on YA dystopian and
      post-apocalypse novels and climate change. In particular, the third chapter can be used to argue the ways in which
      humanist, capitalist mindset hinder discussion on climate change. Goodman also offers insight into where
      Harrison’s contentions fall short, and what areas of discussion need to be further researched.</div>

    </div>
    <div class="annotation">Kidd’s review of Alice Curry’s book highlights the ways in which Curry analyzes YA dystopian
      novels using an ecofeminist and ecocritical lens: “Curry's well-researched and nicely contextualized study spans
      an introduction, six chapters, and a conclusion, across which she treats Anglophone American, Australian, British,
      and South African texts.” Kidd applauses Curry’s analysis on “ecothemed young adult literature.” He acknowledges
      that she narrowed her scholarship only to Western texts, but he contends that this was an intentional decision
      because “the western teen protagonist is especially haunted by her complicity with destructive practices.” Curry
      close reads the following dystopian series in her book: The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, Uglies by Scott
      Westerfield, Exodus by Julie Bertagna, Mortal Engines by Philip Reeve, and standalone novels including Feed by
      M.T. Anderson, The Folk Keeper by Franny Billingsley, The Forest of Hands and Teeth by Carrie Ryan, and How I Live
      Now by Meg Rosoff. Curry presents an in-depth analysis revealing how narratives are unable to separate themselves
      from the hegemonic, colonialist powers that exist in this present day. However, she argues, the narratives do at
      the very least challenge these powers by depicting protagonists who are ““ground[ed]” in earthly, situated and
      empathetic values.” She brings forth the idea that this abstraction of socio-political ideas in dystopian fiction
      allows room to reinterpret and question the forces that are imposed upon us now. This article presents some
      relevant ideas including topics of posthumanism, poststructuralism, and ecofeminism, and its influence on
      perceptions of politics and climate change in dystopian narratives to define and question the role of
      “neoliberalist faith in individual ‘progress.’” Kidd’s review highlights various chapters and themes that Curry
      uses in her analysis and summarizes her arguments in a clear and accessible manner.</div>

    </div>
    <div class="annotation">Baudriller examines the importance and politicization of sci-fi over the ages. He argues
      that sci-fi has offered an abundance of narratives that tackle complex issues and conversations while also being
      accessible to the general population. He then considers the significance of dystopian novels in the understanding
      of current socio-political conversations. He notes a growing shift dystopian narratives where the “dull” and
      “idle” city-life is presented in comparison to the “wild” nature (10). He argues that “[t]he experience of nature
      is personal in these narratives” (11). His first chapter examines the “consequences of human hubris on the human
      body integrity” and the advocation to “return to the natural world” (13). This dissertation includes multiple
      chapters on nature, environment, and the human body. Baudriller examines the ways in which dystopian and
      post-apocalypse novels sever the human body from nature, how the environment is depicted in these novels and the
      effects of such depictions, and how deprivation of a natural earth (because it has been devastated by climate
      change) results in the shift towards an artificial nature. Baudriller’s chapters one and two, specifically, will
      be helpful in establishing a framework as to how discussions of climate change are portrayed in this genre. Using
      his analysis on The Uglies, for instance, could be helpful with determining the implications of severing ties with
      nature. Baudriller mentions but does not go in-depth about the effects of narratives that hinge on climate change
      but do not discuss it, such as when he analyzes The Road by Cormac McCarthy. As such, the text leaves room to
      discuss the implications of skirting around topics of climate change.</div>

      genre, and its importance in current socio-political landscapes. She contends that “[u]nlike other narrative
      genres, utopian and dystopian fiction is highly related to sociology and politics.” Analyzing the following
      trilogies: The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, Uglies by Scott Westerfield, Divergent by Veronica Roth, and
      Across the Universe by Beth Revis, Burgos Mascarell examines the cultural, social, and psychological effects of

      events, and readers’ understanding of their own worlds. This text focuses on the ways in which YA literature

      utilized to teach children how to engage with complex topics relevant to their own lives. Burgos Mascarell’s work

    </div>
    <div class="annotation">Using an ecocritical lens, this thesis analyzes the texts, Life as We Knew It by Susan Beth
      Pfeffer, The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, and The Knife of Never Letting Go by Patrick Ness to see how YA
      literature “might influence readers’ attitudes toward the contemporary anxieties surrounding impending climate
      change.” Dror examines how the relationship between the protagonist and non-human world is depicted in each novel,
      and what this means for the “future of human survival.” She seeks to answer three questions: “1. What is the
      representation of the natural environment in a selection of young adult dystopian literature? 2. What role does
      technology play in a selection of young adult dystopian literature? And 3. How does the young adult protagonist
      interact with the natural environment and technology in a selection of young adult dystopian literature?” Through
      her analysis of each text, Dror demonstrates a separation between human and nature in which nature is deemed “an
      antagonistic nonhuman space.” She examines how each protagonist undergoes a transformation with their
      understanding of the world, and the implications of “inaction, spurred on by the perceived futility of their
      rebellion.” Dror’s research outlines the ways in which nature and technology in dystopias “mirrors contemporary
      twentyfirst century anxieties about human inaction towards climate change and technological reliance as well as
      the resulting burden that is placed on the next generation.” She contends that the three novels present various
      perspectives on the implications of inaction and the necessity of redefining a new relationship with nature. Her
      work offers an ecocritical perspective in YA post-apocalypse literature and insight into the advantages of
      utilizing dystopian literature as a way to propel action in youth.</div>

      The Handmaid’s Tale to Suzanne Collins’ The Hunger Games Trilogy. Diss. 2016.
    </div>
    <div class="annotation">Finnisson defines dystopia and orients us with the ways in which dystopian novels hinge upon
      environmental devastation and politics. Finnisson outlines the various themes embedded in these narratives, and
      how dystopias are not simply imagined, devastated futures, rather they are compilations of past and present
      events. He outlines how the 2008 market crash, for instance, led to readers “to connect more easily with the newly
      published Hunger Games” because “[t]his was when young adults became increasingly aware that they could have a
      slightly worse life than their parents” (3). Finnison also notes that dystopian literature is undergoing yet
      another transformation in which “more female authors, and strong female characters” might be another factor in the
      increasing demand for YA dystopian fiction as it “may serve to make the genre more appealing to a broader
      audience” (3). Comparing “traditional dystopias” like Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell to more contemporary
      dystopias, such as, The Handmaid’s Tale by Margaret Atwood, and The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, to showcase
      how YA dystopias have progressed, how they differ, and what they offer to young readers. Finnison contends that
      “more recent examples” of dystopias work to take warnings embedded in the narrative “to create new possibilities
      for utopian hope within the space of the text” (5). Finnison examines why YA dystopias are becoming more popular,
      and the implications of the increase in demand of the genre. He demonstrates how dystopian fiction allows young
      readers to connect and understand the implications and “potential consequences” of technological and scientific
      progress, the effects of growing biopolitics, and also offers youth the room to imagine “freedom in a world
      influenced by biopolitics” (5). His article outlines how using YA dystopian novels in an academic setting will
      help teach students of historical and present social and political issues. Furthermore, the texts open space to
      discuss and challenge various issues such as climate change. By forming a relationship with the protagonist,
      readers can emulate and embody forms of activism that is not taught elsewhere. The dissertation delves into the
      ways in which dystopian novels promote strong and thinking female characters, and how this is echoed in youth. As
      such, Finnisson’s readings offer insight into the advantages of utilizing YA texts in schools to teach political,
      social, and environmental activism.</div>

      Hawkes, Jessica. Climate Change and Cultural Anxieties: An Exploration of Dystopian Novels from Before and After
      Global Warming. MS thesis. University of Waterloo, 2018.
    </div>
    <div class="annotation">In her dissertation, Hawkes attempts to tackle the absence of climate change in sci-fi
      novels. She argues that “popular political narratives about climate change do not engage with the crisis in any
      meaningful way,” which results in inaction on behalf of the general population (1). She believes that the
      literature gap on topics of climate change hinder the average person’s understanding of the issue and “divert our
      attention from the urgency of the crisis and the need for drastic change to our lifestyles and social systems”
      (2). Hawkes examines how climate change is depicted in sci-fi and dystopian novels. She questions whether texts
      start including topics of climate change after the term “global warming” is established, and whether the issue
      will become more prevalent in more recently published narratives. Her ecocritical readings of the pre-1975 texts:
      J. G. Ballard’s The Drowned World, Ursula Le Guin’s The Word For World Is Forest, and Walter Miller Jr.’s A
      Canticle for Leibowitz, and post-1975 texts: Margaret Atwood’s MaddAddam trilogy (Oryx and Crake, The Year of the
      5 Flood, and MaddAddam) as well as two novels by Paolo Bacigalupi: The Windup Girl and The Water Knife, explores
      how environment is depicted and used as a plot element. Using an ecocritical lens, she analyzes how the texts
      recognize “the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on the environment as well as human populations” and the
      implications of each depiction. She argues that to better understand and evaluate discussions on climate change,
      it is important to view them on a spectrum that recognizes the political ideologies that each narrative presents.
      Hawke’s findings reveal the complicated nature of climate change in dystopian literature. Her analyses offer
      insight into the multiple ways environment, nature, and climate change are represented in dystopian texts.</div>

      California State University, Fresno, 2020.
    </div>
    <div class="annotation">Leean’s thesis focuses on reiterating the importance of YA dystopian novels in an academic
      setting. He uses three texts, The Giver by Lois Lowry, The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, and Legend by Marie Lu
      to demonstrate the benefits of using them in elementary academic curriculums. Leean claims that because
      contemporary YA dystopian fiction is now a part of the mainstream culture, it has “begun to lose credibility in
      the academic setting;” however, he contends that “YA dystopian literature is an essential part of educating
      students in critical thinking, for it allows for a creative and open space in which students may articulate the
      problems they see in society, and then collaborate on ways in which these problems may be treated.” Leean’s
      analysis of the three novels give insight into the complex political nature of the narrative, and the
      socio-political awareness that is raised amongst young students when they are exposed to such narratives. Using
      his case studies, this text offers discourse on not only the benefits of teaching YA dystopia in classroom, but
      also ways to engage students with political themes and topics. Chapters on The Hunger Games, for instance, helps
      to understand the political, historical and social backgrounds that are evident in YA dystopian fiction, and how
      these can be drawn out in an interdisciplinary manner to educate children. Sections such as 2.4, 3.4, and 4.4,
      take elements of the respective novel analyzed to explain how the narratives push forward political engagement in
      their readers. Moreover, the chapter on eliciting social activism in students through these novels offer methods
      of teaching and reading these texts that is both accessible and inspiring for children. Leean’s dissertation
      offers an in-depth understanding of both the importance of YA dystopian fiction and the potential influence it can
      have on the younger generation.</div>

      Catastrophe: Hyper-capitalism and Severe Climate Change in Science Fiction. Diss. Curtin University, 2018.
    </div>
    <div class="annotation">The role of speculative fiction in its portrayal of climate change is examined in this
      dissertation. Sparks examines different forms of climate change depiction, including part one “Capitalocene
      Dreams” which talks about neoliberalism and the consequences of pushing forward a “collective lack of action” on
      behalf of the general population, and part two “Hyper-Capitalism and Severe Climate Change” which examines
      cultural effects such as overpopulation, pollution, and scarcity which leads to an environmental crisis. She
      argues that “capitalism [is] the biggest issue of here and now—the underlying cause of ecological damage and
      continuing unsustainability—and the greatest threat to our planet’s future.” The dissertation then focuses on
      Anthropocene fiction as it develops into a new genre to see how it offers a new structural framework against the
      looming threat of climate change. The section on “Capitalocene Dreams” offers multiple short stories that depict
      the influence of neoliberal thought on climate change. In each story, a new element of political inaction and its
      repercussions on the environment is brought to light as characters grapple with the aftereffects of such neglect.
      Sparks begins the second part of her dissertation by outlining the history and significance of the term
      “speculative fiction” and “sci-fi.” Although there has been a shift historically in the importance and value of
      sci-fi, and climate change fiction has been labelled as a subgenre of sci-fi, Sparks contends that the genre of
      sci-fi takes away from climate change fiction. Rather, climate change fiction should be its own separate genre.
      She then continues to define the importance of short stories in the depiction of climate change. In a world that
      has become more and more fast-paced and technological, she highlights arguments that claim that short fiction is
      “compatible with smartphone culture, allowing for instant access.” The following chapters in the second section of
      her thesis outline the historical and political background of speculative fiction, climate fiction, and the
      influence it has on the general population. Her final two chapters are particularly relevant to the genres of
      climate change fiction, and the ability to reframe imagined future political structures to better the world that
      we live in.</div>
