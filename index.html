                        MGB's Archives is a collection of primary and secondary texts that explores topics of climate change in Young Adult fiction literature.

                        YA dystopian and post-apocalypse literature commonly centers on ecological disaster which results in the protagonist navigating the remnants of the world to survive. Interestingly, despite the end-of-the-world being an ecological disaster, there is a gap between conversations on climate change and what is depicted in these novels. Professor Miranda Green-Barteet and her colleagues have developed this database to offer literature and texts that fill these gaps. This database works as a place for readers, writers, and researchers to have access to the most recent and most relevant sources pertaining to climate change.
