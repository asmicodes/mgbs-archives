                          <li>Global warming has transformed the Earth, and it's about to get even hotter. The Arctic Ice Cap has all but
                            melted,
                            and the international community is racing desperately to claim the massive amounts of oil beneath the newly
                            accessible
                            ocean. Enter the Gaia Corporation. Its two founders have come up with a plan to roll back global warming.
                            Thousands of
                            tiny mirrors floating in the air can create a giant sunshade, capable of redirecting heat and cooling the
                            earth's
                            surface. They plan to terraform Earth to save it from itself-but in doing so, they have created a superweapon

                            likes of which the world has never seen. Anika Duncan is an airship pilot for the underfunded United Nations
                            Polar
                            Guard. She's intent on capturing a smuggled nuclear weapon that has made it into the Polar Circle and bringing
                            the
                            smugglers to justice. Anika finds herself caught up in a plot by a cabal of military agencies and corporations

                          <li>In this brilliant, essential book, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Thomas L. Friedman speaks to America's urgent
                            need
                            for national renewal and explains how a green revolution can bring about both a sustainable environment and a
                            sustainable America. Friedman explains how global warming, rapidly growing populations, and the expansion of the
                            world’s middle class through globalization have produced a dangerously unstable planet--one that is "hot, flat,
                            and
                            crowded." In this Release 2.0 edition, he also shows how the very habits that led us to ravage the natural world
                            led
                            to the meltdown of the financial markets and the Great Recession. Friedman proposes that an ambitious national
                            strategy—which he calls “Geo-Greenism”—is not only what we need to save the planet from overheating; it is what
                            we
                            need to make America healthier, richer, more innovative, more productive, and more secure. The challenge of a
                            sustainable way of life presents the United States with an opportunity not only to rebuild its economy, but to
                            lead
                            the world in radically innovating toward cleaner energy. And it could inspire Americans to something we haven't
                            seen
                            in a long time--nation-building in America--by summoning the intelligence, creativity, and concern for the
                            common
                            good

                          <li>#1 bestseller, winner of the Hilary Weston Writers' Trust Prize for Non-Fiction, and Naomi Klein's most
                            important
                            book yet--about the economic drivers that are warming our planet and how the climate crisis can yet spur
                            economic,
                            cultural and political transformation. Klein argues that our current growth-based economic model is waging war
                            on
                            the
                            life support systems of our planet. Using phenomenal research, she lays out why climate change is not an
                            "issue"--it
                            is a civilizational wake-up call, a powerful message delivered in the language of fires, floods, storms and
                            droughts.
                            Klein attacks the dominant economic policies of deregulated capitalism and endless resource extraction, and
                            brilliantly identifies the threads that connect our failed responses to the crisis--from hard-core climate
                            deniers
                            to
                            celebrity billionaires with messiah complexes, to the reckless quest to engineer the planet--and she reveals how
                            the
                            "Big Green" environmental organizations may be hurting more than helping. She argues that we urgently need an
                            entirely
                            new model of human progress and shows why climate change--with its full economic and moral implications
                            understood--is
                            the most powerful weapon we have ever had in the fight for equality and social justice. Tracing the rise of a
                            bold
                            new

                            failed
                            systems--solutions that require us to break virtually every rule in the free-market playbook. The climate change

                          <li>Pressia barely remembers the Detonations or much about life during the Before. In her sleeping cabinet behind
                            the
                            rubble of an old barbershop where she lives with her grandfather, she thinks about what is lost -
                            how the world
                            went
                            from amusement parks, movie theaters, birthday parties, fathers and mothers . . . to ash and dust, scars,
                            permanent
                            burns, and fused, damaged bodies. And now, at an age when everyone is required to turn themselves over to the
                            militia
                            to either be trained as a soldier or, if they are too damaged and weak, to be used as live targets, Pressia can
                            no
                            longer pretend to be small. Pressia is on the run.
                    
                            Burn a Pure and Breathe the Ash . . .
                            There are those who escaped the apocalypse unmarked. Pures. They are tucked safely inside the Dome that protects
                            their
                            healthy, superior bodies. Yet Partridge, whose father is one of the most influential men in the Dome, feels
                            isolated
                            and lonely. Different. He thinks about loss-maybe just because his family is broken; his father is emotionally
                            distant; his brother killed himself; and his mother never made it inside their shelter. Or maybe it's his
                            claustrophobia: his feeling that this Dome has become a swaddling of intensely rigid order. So when a slipped
                            phrase
                            suggests his mother might still be alive, Partridge risks his life to leave the Dome to find her.
                    
                            When Pressia meets Partridge, their worlds shatter all over again.</li>

                          <li>The world has no air. If you want to survive, you pay to breathe. But what if you can't? And what if you think
                            everything could be different? Three teens will leave everything they know behind in Sarah Crossan's gripping
                            and
                            original dystopian teen novel of danger, longing, and glimmering hope.
                    
                            Ever since the Switch, when the oxygen levels plummeted and most of humanity died, the survivors have been
                            protected
                            in glass domes full of manufactured air. Protected . . . or trapped? Or controlled? Alina's a revolutionary who
                            believes we can save the environment. Quinn's a Premium who's never had to worry about having enough air. His
                            best
                            friend, Bea, is an Auxiliary who's never worried about anything but having enough air. When the three cross
                            paths,
                            they will change everything.</li>
