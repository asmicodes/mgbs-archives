                    <div class="annotation">This text focuses on why YA Dystopian and post-apocalypse texts should be taught in schools, and how exposing students to such texts benefits their understanding of the world and politics. Alfes and her team demonstrate the benefits of including YA post-apocalypse and dystopian texts in secondary school curriculums through four case studies. Teachers noticed that the implementation of such texts had the potential of improving language efficiency in students, the texts were versatile and opened intercultural discussion amongst students, thereby broadening their knowledge on thematic ideologies, and exposure to the texts also improved students’ critical thinking skills. This text offers insight into the ways YA literature can be used in academic settings, and how forming an educational framework that targets discussion on climate change through these novels can help improve student engagement on the matter. As demonstrated through the case studies, YA literature has the capacity to not only engage students’ in topics about climate change but to also push them into feeling concern for their planet. As such, understanding ways in which this genre neglects to forefront issues of climate change, and merging it with educational curriculums can help format a potential framework to better connect students with the environment.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Summarizing the plots of the four following YA books: Ship Breaker by Paolo Bacigalupi, Ella Minnow Pea by Mark Dunn, The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman, and I am Malala by Malala Yousafzai, this essay demonstrates the ways in which themes of community connect students to each other and the novels. The essay focuses on how “[q]uality young adult literature can provide a vehicle for facilitating the exploration of community, its role in young people’s lives, and adolescents’ place within it” (55). In each summary, Anderson, Goldsworthy, and MacQueen focus on elements that the text offers in relation to adolescent identity. In Ship Breaker, for instance, they highlight how morality, interrelationships, and social class differences are few of the many themes evident in the narrative. Ultimately, the essay highlights how young readers can learn and build their own identities through the way the character grows. This essay offers a quick look into the potential ways YA literature can be taught to students in order to forefront complex and intersectional issues such as climate change, or race. By focusing curriculums or conversations on specific themes that are highlighted in the article, youth can better connect with their environment can develop their understanding of complex real-world issues.

                    <div class="annotation">In a collection of essays, this book works to see how YA dystopian and post-apocalypse novels are both a source of education and escape for young readers. The essays discuss how the genres “teach serious lessons about the issues faced by humanity, and [offer] readers a pleasurable retreat from their quotidian experience" (5). Basu, Broad, and Hintz’ essay focuses on dystopian fiction and identity politics. Through her analysis of Divergent by Veronica Roth, and Curse Workers Series by Holly Black, the authors work to examine the significance of an “essential self” and the ways in which politics inhibits it. The following sections then focus on body surveillance and space, and how that works with developing identity. Von Mossner and Baccolini’s essay in part two discusses “critical eco-dystopia” through her analysis of the Carbon Diaries. This section would be helpful in understanding how environment and relationship with nature can develop political identities. Finally, part four looks into posthumanism and biotechonologies to see how YA fiction can depict better futures. Their readings focus on how relationships with space, environment, and nature work to build political identities amongst youth. Their discussion on posthumanism as a source of reconciliation between nature and the human highlight alternative ways cli-fi literature can be taught and read to establish a personal and collaborative relationship
                      with the world.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">This book defines dystopia and post-apocalypse internationally, showcasing the way the term changes from nation to nation. The text delves into the colonial and capitalistic histories that influence the depiction of post-apocalypse and dystopian worlds. Sections including: “The Cultural Logic of Post-Capitalism: Cormac McCarthy’s The Road and Popular Dystopia” by Carl F. Miller, “The Dystopia of the Obsolete”: Lisa Robertson’s Vancouver and the Poetics of Nostalgia” by Paul Stephens, “Post-Frontier and Re-Definition of Space in Tropic of Orange” by Hande Tekdemir, and “Our Posthuman Adolescence: Dystopia, Information Technologies, and the Construction of Subjectivity in M.T. Anderson’s Feed” by Richard Gooding, tackle concepts most relevant to climate change, nature, and identity in dystopias and post-apocalypse fiction. Gooding’s chapter examines the “difficulty of reconciling dystopian pessimism with the traditional hopefulness” of dystopian fiction in M.T. Anderson’s Feed. His close reading of the novel demonstrates how environment, nature, and technology influences the protagonist’s identity and subjectivity. Stephen’s chapter analyzes Lisa Robertson’s poetry and prose to see the ways in which space, nature, and history defines identity. He explores how Robertson uses space to critique “the political mechanisms of capitalist society” and to “resituate [women] historically” by engaging in practices of nostalgia and obsolescence (252). Miller’s chapter analyzes The Road by Cormac McCarthy and argues that the novel’s “depiction of post-capitalism and the loss of a global economy results in a hyper-localized and hopelessly fragmented notion of humanity. In such a way, The Road provides a striking theoretical commentary on the legacy of capitalism and projects an overwhelmingly dystopian view of the loss of popular and consumer culture” (161). The chapter focuses on “whether history can survive the inverse triumph of nature of modernization” (198). The bookoffers multiple close readings of texts that examine human relationship with nature, the posthuman and adolescent identity, as well as the influence of capitalism and post-capitalism in imagined futures.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Blouin begins his book by considering the ways in which neoliberal agendas inhibit progress from preventing climate change. Chapter 8 focuses on how neoliberalism has formed a “dissonance” between the need for collective action, and “absolute freedom” (205). Using Foucault’s theory on “neoliberal schematics,” Blouin outlines how in the wake “against fascism” members of the school of thought “idolize[d] free thinkers that remain skeptical of solidarity movements,” and as such collectivism became a common antagonist (206). In the move to define neoliberalism, the term itself became ambiguous and convoluted. To this day, confusion surrounding the term has resulted in a conflict in agendas. In his analysis of The Hunger Games, Blouin shows how the trilogy “upholds a neoliberal framework under the illusion of its destruction” (208). He argues that her political journey is only a symptom of neoliberalist ideologies. He considers the implications of depicting such a government and highlights the importance of Katniss’ decision to advocate for a more holistic approach. Blouin contends that her seemingly utopian decision that acknowledges “[g]overnments will never solve the problem of power; a different kind of social arrangement must emerge,” does not separate her from neoliberal thought (210). In fact, he goes on to demonstrate how her decision reinforces individualist freedom that falls in line with neoliberalism instead of offering a collectivist solution, or an alternative framework for the future. Chapter five also argues how economics and politics undermine conversation about climate change through “greenwashing.” As such, Hollywood depictions of climate change are often romanticized, and serious conversation about it is swept under the rug. Blouin contends that the only way to target the issue is to be able to discuss the issue; unless media and literature open dialogue about climate change as it is, awareness will not improve. Blouin’s work offers a reason as to why texts sideline topics of climate change. His research can be helpful in establishing the political underbelly of climate change, and the parasitic nature of neoliberalism.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">In this chapter, Bull, Byrne, and Dupuis outline the benefits of incorporating YA fiction texts interdisciplinarily in schools. They argue that by using YA literature in different disciplines as a learning tool can better accommodate “reluctant readers” by exposing them to relevant texts and narratives that interest them. Not only will this increase learning but will also allow students to use critical thinking skills in a wide variety of topics, including science. Section 2 of their chapter focuses on environmentalism and the importance of curating a curriculum that connect interdisciplinary concepts to each other and to students’ lives. This section demonstrates how a text can be used to teach both the language arts and science so that students are able to receive a multimodal form of learning and deeper understanding of the topic. The authors draw out a framework using Ship Breaker by Paolo Bacigalupi as an example of how a potential curriculum could look. They focus on questions that broaden students’ understanding and motivation to learn further about the subject. This text will be particularly helpful in providing insights as to how using YA apocalypse novels to discuss topics of climate change and environmentalism will be beneficial in an academic setting. Using fiction narratives to teach students about real life problems can help target the very impending issue about climate change.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">In this interview, Stephanie LeManger delves into the importance of cli-fi, and its influence in mainstream social activism and awareness. She discusses how cli-fi in pop culture in particular has opened conversation in the mainstream as well as academia about issues on climate change. LeManger contends that the inclusion of cli-fi in academia and mainstream has demonstrated the impact that fiction literature has on social change, advocating for or against political climates, and mediating social crises. She claims that cli-fi novels and films is a “gateway” towards social action. LeManger considers the absences evident in cli-fi literature, as well as our understanding of posthumanism (and the exclusion of Indigenous philosophies). She argues that “academic writing … is also a form of vitality … [and] that it is social action.” The interview tackles the process of writing, reading dystopian texts. It gives insight into the ways in which academica can beutilized as a form for social activism, and the importance of using these texts to better educate the general population.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Chattopadhyay’s review of “Apocalyptic Projections: A Study of Past Predictions, Current Trends and Future Intimations as Related to Film and Literature” focuses on how the author, Anette Magid, outlines the freedom that YA apocalypse fiction offers for imagining alternative futures. Although this article is not directly connected to the topic of climate change, it does provide an alternative intersectional framework that can be used to examine reasons and potential resolutions for the issue. For instance, Magid’s analysis of culture and eugenics (or definition of what it means to be human) can be used to examine the ways in which the posthuman might play a part in understanding issues of climate change. Essays such as Julian Cornell’s “Getting the Doomsday We Deserve: Rolan Emmerich’s 2012 and the Neoliberal Disaster Film” provide an “ambitious … attempt to couple themes of climate change disaster film with eroding American economic hegemony.” This essay focuses on how “the American disaster film is inherently conservative, even when it invokes the wider globe,” which “provides a useful if indirect insight into the changing face of sf as a genre.” Essays within the book offer insight into the issues of Western monopolies on media and narrative portrayals of the post-apocalypse, and what a potential global approach could look like. Chattopadhyay emphasizes that the “collection could have worked better with a reduced selection” but will still “make a useful companion for courses on apocalypses and dystopias.” As such, Magid’s collection of essays provide a useful foundation with various perspectives to understand the complex nature of YA narratives.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Donawerth’s review of Octavia Butler’s conversation on writing science fiction gives insight into how the genre was used to drive forth social reform. In the collection of interviews with Octavia Butler, the book “offers a good overview of the inconsistencies in Butler’s representation of herself.” Although Donaweth laments that the book is not organized chronologically and does not include oral interviews with Butler, it is still a great resource to understand Butler’s writing process. The collection gives insight as to how she uses multiple disciplines and targets multiple audiences to acknowledge and act against social injustices. Butler believes “that she views novels as ‘preaching’” and that through her novels, she can reform the human race from its “destructive biological urges.” Interviews on texts such as Kindred, or The Parable of the Sower, for instance, offer insight into how and why Butler chose to represent race, gender, and climate change the way that she did in her narratives. Understanding her intent and use of the sf genre to motivate change and action will better connect readers to the importance of narratives in terms of political action.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Baudriller examines the importance and politicization of sci-fi over the ages. He argues that sci-fi has offered an abundance of narratives that tackle complex issues and conversations while also being accessible to the general population. He then considers the significance of dystopian novels in the understanding of current socio-political conversations. He notes a growing shift dystopian narratives where the “dull” and “idle” city-life is presented in comparison to the “wild” nature (10). He argues that “[t]he experience of nature is personal in these narratives” (11). His first chapter examines the “consequences of human hubris on the human body integrity” and the advocation to “return to the natural world” (13). This dissertation includes multiple chapters on nature, environment, and the human body. Baudriller examines the ways in which dystopian and post-apocalypse novels sever the human body from nature, how the environment is depicted in these novels and the effects of such depictions, and how deprivation of a natural earth (because it has been devastated by climate change) results in the shift towards an artificial nature. Baudriller’s chapters one and two, specifically, will be helpful in establishing a framework as to how discussions of climate change are portrayed in this genre. Using his analysis on The Uglies, for instance, could be helpful with determining the implications of severing ties with nature. Baudriller mentions but does not go in-depth about the effects of narratives that hinge on climate change but do not discuss it, such as when he analyzes The Road by Cormac McCarthy. As such, the text leaves room to discuss the implications of skirting around topics of climate change.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">In her thesis, Burgos Mascarell discusses the emerging young adult dystopian science-fiction genre, and its importance in current socio-political landscapes. She contends that “[u]nlike other narrative genres, utopian and dystopian fiction is highly related to sociology and politics.” Analyzing the following trilogies: The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, Uglies by Scott Westerfield, Divergent by Veronica Roth, and Across the Universe by Beth Revis, Burgos Mascarell examines the cultural, social, and psychological effects of each narrative on adolescent readers. She determines how narratives work to imitate and influence real life events, and readers’ understanding of their own worlds. This text focuses on the ways in which YA literature presents opportunity to take political action. Through the reflection of real-world events, these texts can be utilized to teach children how to engage with complex topics relevant to their own lives. Burgos Mascarell’s work outlines how YA dystopian literature offers a psychological and sociologically fulfilling experience that connects readers to both the fiction world and real-life.</div>
