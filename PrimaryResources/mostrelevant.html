                      <li>Global warming has transformed the Earth, and it's about to get even hotter. The Arctic Ice Cap has all but
                        melted,
                        and the international community is racing desperately to claim the massive amounts of oil beneath the newly
                        accessible
                        ocean. Enter the Gaia Corporation. Its two founders have come up with a plan to roll back global warming.
                        Thousands of
                        tiny mirrors floating in the air can create a giant sunshade, capable of redirecting heat and cooling the
                        earth's
                        surface. They plan to terraform Earth to save it from itself-but in doing so, they have created a superweapon
                        the
                        likes of which the world has never seen. Anika Duncan is an airship pilot for the underfunded United Nations
                        Polar
                        Guard. She's intent on capturing a smuggled nuclear weapon that has made it into the Polar Circle and bringing
                        the
                        smugglers to justice. Anika finds herself caught up in a plot by a cabal of military agencies and corporations
                        who
                        want Gaia Corporation stopped. But when Gaia Corp loses control of their superweapon, it will be Anika who has
                        to
                        decide the future of the world. The nuclear weapon she has risked her life to find is the only thing that can
                        stop
                        the

                        overdeveloped
                        metropolis that most of the population now calls home. If they stay in the city, Agnes will die. There is only
                        one
                        alternative: the Wilderness State, the last swath of untouched, protected land, where people have always been
                        forbidden. Until now. Bea, Agnes, and eighteen others volunteer to live in the Wilderness State, guinea pigs in
                        an
                        experiment to see if humans can exist in nature without destroying it. Living as nomadic hunter-gatherers, they

                        and painfully learn to survive in an unpredictable, dangerous land, bickering and battling for power and control

                        that
                        saving her daughter’s life means losing her in a different way. The farther they get from civilization, the more
                        their
                        bond is tested in astonishing and heartbreaking ways. At once a blazing lament of our contempt for nature and a

                        into the ocean and southern California will waste away to desert; the relocation process will cost trillions of
                        dollars. With the world frighteningly close to catastrophe, Benton opts to abandon multilateral negotiations in
                        the
                        Kyoto 4 summit and resumes secret bilateral negotiations with the Chinese—the world's worst polluter. As the two
                        superpowers lock horns, the ensuing battle of wits becomes a race against time. Ultimatum is a visionary and
                        deeply
                        unsettling thriller that explores the most pressing issue of the twenty-first century—the future of our
                        planet—and
                        boldly predicts the way the world will be in twenty-five years.</li>

                      <li>Perched on a sloping hill, set away from a small town by the sea, the High House has a tide pool and a mill, a
                        vegetable garden, and, most importantly, a barn full of supplies. Caro, Pauly, Sally, and Grandy are safe, so
                        far,
                        from the rising water that threatens to destroy the town and that has, perhaps, already destroyed everything
                        else.
                        But
                        for how long? Caro and her younger half-brother, Pauly, arrive at the High House after her father and stepmother
                        fall
                        victim to a faraway climate disaster—but not before they call and urge Caro to leave London. In their new home,
                        a
                        converted summer house cared for by Grandy and his granddaughter, Sally, the two pairs learn to live together.
                        Yet
                        there are limits to their safety, limits to the supplies, limits to what Grandy—the former village caretaker, a
                        man
                        who knows how to do everything—can teach them as his health fails. A searing novel that takes on parenthood,
                        sacrifice, love, and survival under the threat of extinction, The High House is a stunning, emotionally precise
                        novel
                        about what can be salvaged at the end of the world.</li>

                      <li>Patrick Hamlin arrives in Hollywood to assume a vague role on the set of the movie version of his latest
                        novel.
                        But
                        everything about the process is befuddling—the movie script barely resembles his story, and his role is
                        relegated
                        to
                        listening to the semiphilosophical ramblings of the production assistants and transporting Cassidy Carter, the
                        tempestuous former child actor–turned–B-lister that is starring in the film. Patrick is increasingly alarmed by
                        the
                        things he witnesses: Wildfires flare constantly; everyone drinks a luxe synthetic product called WAT-R that is
                        “the
                        same as water, just a little bit more so.” And there is a mysterious “dementia” that is afflicting people
                        seemingly at
                        random, regardless of age. As the surrealism of the film-set experiences blend with the nightmarishness of LA,
                        Patrick
                        is also coming unglued by developments at home: His emotionally fragile wife and their 9-year-old daughter are
                        staying
                        at an upstate New York commune, where they participate in group mourning rituals as a kind of ecological grief
                        work.
                        It isn’t long before everything in Patrick’s life feels like it’s spiraling toward disaster. Kleeman’s novel is
                        idea-driven, a critique of the artifice of consumerism and Hollywood culture in which that artifice is
                        heightened
                        on
                        each page, from characters talking in polished soliloquies to the ominous ubiquity of WAT-R bottles in
                        everyone’s
                        hands. Everything in this world is deliberately just a little bit off, like the slight telltale warp of a
                        Photoshopped
                        selfie. While some readers might find the novel overly conceptual, it’s undeniably fun to watch Kleeman juggle
                        genre,
                        from mystery to domestic drama, from cli-fi to ghost story. An admirably eclectic take on environmental
                        dystopia.</li>

                      <li>The Carbon Diaries by Saci Lloyd is a 2011 book set in the then near future of 2015 London. The UK is
                        implementing
                        carbon rationing after a catastrophic storm brings the reality of climate change into full focus. Laura lives
                        with
                        her
                        Mum, Dad and antisocial older sister Kim. It is through first person diary-fiction that we are drawn into a
                        world
                        not
                        too dissimilar from our own in which society is “addicted to oil and gas” (Lloyd 2011, pp. 25). Laura tries to
                        go
                        through the motions of everyday life, negotiating family conflict, changing friendships, sexuality and
                        education,
                        but
                        her life is frequently disrupted by extremely volatile weather patterns. The clippings and images throughout the
                        book
                        enhance the immersion of the reader and lend credence to the diary as a fictional found artefact. The novel
                        introduces
                        the new world order of environmental awareness and resource austerity with the idea of carbon rations. This
                        system
                        of
                        rationing restricts the luxuries of the inhabitants of London and forces them to pay attention to their carbon
                        consumption, balancing their use of energy and resources. The young people in the narrative experience a period
                        of
                        adjustment which causes them to confront how they define youth and necessity. As the novel progresses the
                        response
                        to
                        the carbon restrictions begins to normalise and the storms and droughts highlight the need for extreme action on
                        climate change.</li>

                      <li>An engrossing, satirical and very funny new novel on climate change. Michael Beard is in his late fifties;
                        bald,
                        overweight, unprepossessing — a Nobel Prize-winning physicist whose best work is behind him. Trading on his
                        reputation, he speaks for enormous fees, lends his name to the letterheads of renowned scientific institutions
                        and
                        half-heartedly heads a government-backed initiative tackling global warming. An inveterate philanderer, Beard
                        finds
                        his fifth marriage floundering. But this time it is different: she is having the affair, and he is still in love
                        with
                        her. When Beard's professional and personal worlds are entwined in a freak accident, an opportunity presents
                        itself, a
                        chance for Beard to extricate himself from his marital mess, reinvigorate his career and very possibly save the
                        world
                        from environmental disaster. With a global scope, Solar is a comedy dealing directly with the crises of today. A
                        story
                        of one man's ambitions and self-deceptions, it is a startling and stylish new departure in the work of one of
                        the
                        world's great writers.</li>

                      <li>After the climate wars, a floating city is constructed in the Arctic Circle, a remarkable feat of mechanical
                        and
                        social engineering, complete with geothermal heating and sustainable energy. The city’s denizens have become
                        accustomed to a roughshod new way of living, however, the city is starting to fray along the edges—crime and
                        corruption have set in, the contradictions of incredible wealth alongside direst poverty are spawning unrest,
                        and
                        a
                        new disease called “the breaks” is ravaging the population. When a strange new visitor arrives—a woman riding an
                        orca,
                        with a polar bear at her side—the city is entranced. The “orcamancer,” as she’s known, very subtly brings
                        together
                        four people—each living on the periphery—to stage unprecedented acts of resistance. By banding together to save
                        their
                        city before it crumbles under the weight of its own decay, they will learn shocking truths about themselves.
                        Blackfish
                        City is a remarkably urgent—and ultimately very hopeful—novel about political corruption, organized crime,
                        technology
                        run amok, the consequences of climate change, gender identity, and the unifying power of human connection.

                        centuries
                        ago continues to be the defining quandary of the wet, wild rainforests along the shores of the Pacific
                        Northwest.
                        It
                        seethes below the tides of the fictional town of Good River Harbor, a little village pressed against the
                        mountains—homeland to bears, whales, and a few weather–worn families. In Piano Tide, the debut novel by
                        award–winning
                        naturalist, philosopher, activist and author Kathleen Dean Moore, we are introduced to town father Axel
                        Hagerman,
                        who
                        has made a killing in this remote Alaskan harbor by selling off the spruce, the cedar, the herring and halibut.
                        But
                        when he decides to export the water from a salmon stream, he runs head–long into young Nora Montgomery, just
                        arrived
                        on the ferry with her piano and her dog. Nora has burned her bridges in the lower 48, and she aims to disappear
                        into
                        this new homeland, with her piano as her anchor. But when Axel’s next business proposition, a bear pit, turns
                        lethal,
                        Nora has to act. The clash, when it comes, is a spectacular and transformative act of resistance.</li>

                        the
                        same thing: high hopes that they may finally hook up with some cool guys...and it never happens. But this year,
                        they're sure it's going to be different. So it's totally amazing when out of nowhere they meet two unbelievably
                        adorable boys who are just too cute to be true! Which, they soon discover, may be the case. A lot of odd things
                        happen
                        when Steve and Dave are around. Reese figures it's because they're not from around here. So where are they from,
                        France? Well, not quite... Summoned from the depths of the sea by the dire threat of global pollution, friendly

                        those,
                        like sixteen-year-old Gaia Stone, who live outside. Following in her mother's footsteps Gaia has become a

                        and
                        Keller Sullivan feel at home. For a few blissful weeks each year they study the habits of Emperor and Adelie
                        penguins
                        and find solace in their work and in one another. But Antarctica, like their fleeting romance, is a fragile
                        place,
                        imperiled by the world to the north. Each year, Deb and Keller play tour guide to the passengers on the small
                        expedition ship that ferries them to their research station. But this year, when Keller fails to appear on
                        board,
                        Deb
                        begins to reconsider their complicated past and the uncertainty of any future they might share. Then, shortly
                        into
                        the
                        journey, Deb’s ship receives an emergency signal from The Australis, a cruise liner that has hit desperate
                        trouble
                        in
                        the ice-choked waters of the Southern Ocean. Soon Deb’s role will change from researcher to rescuer; among the
                        crew of
                        that sinking ship, Deb learns, is Keller. As Deb and Keller’s troubled histories collide in this “original and
                        entirely authentic love story” (Graeme Simsion, author of The Rosie Project), Midge Raymond takes us on an
                        unforgettable voyage deep into the wonders of the Antarctic and the mysteries of the human heart. My Last
                        Continent is
                        “a sensitive exploration of how the smallest action can ripple through an ecosystem—seemingly impenetrable, but
                        as
                        fragile as the human heart” (The Minneapolis Star-Tribune). “Atmospheric and adventurous...The story and vivid

                      <li>"The Heatstroke Line" is a novel that shows what climate change will do to the United States. It is intended
                        as
                        a
                        warning. Many Americans are willing to deny the reality of climate change because they think that it will only
                        affect
                        tropical countries and oceanic islands that are far away from us. The Heatstroke Line depicts a United States
                        that
                        with its coastal cities flooded and its remaining land sweltering under debilitating heat. It has broken into
                        smaller
                        units that are in conflict with each other and it is dominated by more northerly nations, such as Canada, that
                        now
                        have temperate climates. There are already a number of "cli-fi" novels that deal with global warming. But most
                        of
                        these belong within the category of post-apocalyptic science fiction. They use a disaster — nuclear war,
                        epidemic
                        or
                        ecological disaster — to wipe away the complexities or modern civilization and tell an adventure story. The
                        Heatstroke
                        Line is different. It shows an imaginable future, not very distant from the present, when there are still modern
                        houses, cars, governments, schools and political conflicts. The purpose is to bring home to Americans the
                        devastating
                        effects that climate change might have on our nation. “The Heatstroke Line" is a real story — relatively short,
                        filled
                        with action and written in simple, easy to read prose. It does not preach and it does not try to advance
                        scientific
                        arguments. Its goal is to make the consequences of climate change real and immediate. It is intended to motivate
                        people who believe that climate change is real to take action, and to induce those who deny climate change to
                        re-think
                        their position.</li>

                      <li>The Ministry for the Future is a masterpiece of the imagination, using fictional eyewitness accounts to tell
                        the
                        story of how climate change will affect us all. Its setting is not a desolate, postapocalyptic world, but a
                        future
                        that is almost upon us. Chosen by Barack Obama as one of his favorite books of the year, this extraordinary
                        novel
                        from
                        visionary science fiction writer Kim Stanley Robinson will change the way you think about the climate crisis.
                        Established in 2025, the purpose of the new organization was simple: To advocate for the world’s future
                        generations
                        and to protect all living creatures, present and future. It soon became known as the Ministry for the Future,
                        and
                        this
                        is its story. Its setting is not a desolate, post-apocalyptic world, but a future that is almost upon us – and
                        in
                        which we might just overcome the extraordinary challenges we face. It is a novel both immediate and impactful,
                        desperate and hopeful in equal measure, and it is one of the most powerful and original books on climate change
                        ever

                      <li>On a hotter and more volatile earth in the twenty-third century, humans like Clare and Jon live in utopia,
                        hunting
                        and gathering in small tribal bands, engaged in daily art and ritual, reunited with old friends like the shaggy
                        mammoth and giant ground sloth. Even better, they still have solar</li>
                      <li>powered laptops and can communicate with each
                        other around the world. The understanding of physics has also advanced. When scientists first cloned extinct
                        species
                        from the Pleistocene, they discovered that many of them were telepathic—that consciousness travels in waves. For
                        most
                        people, animism has become the preferred religion, a panpsychism compatible with the laws of a fractal
                        holographic
                        universe. As Clare tells one of her students, the return to an older, Paleolithic lifestyle is “one of
                        humanity’s
                        greatest achievements.” It’s too bad that utopia had to come at such a cost: a genetically engineered
                        super-virus
                        that
                        wiped out most of earth’s human population. Humanity was shaken by that event, and humanity vowed to change.
                        Now,
                        on
                        the 150th anniversary of that catastrophe, a small group of men and women—as well as a smarter-than-average dire
                        wolf
                        and saber-toothed cat—are suddenly faced with decisions in which the stakes are higher than ever before. Will
                        earth
                        repeat the cycle of unbridled hubris? Or is humanity’s destiny even stranger than that?</li>

                        family
                        tragedy, she’s adrift at thirty and―despite her early promise as a painter―on the verge of sinking her career.

                        a near-future earth with soaring heat, toxic waters, tricked-out amphibious vehicles, ice-themed dance clubs and

                        that grow up on vines. Varik Teitur inherits a vast sea farm after the mysterious drowning of his marine
                        biologist
                        father.When Marisa Baron, a beautiful and shrewd terrorist, who knows way too much about Varik's father's work,
                        tries
                        to steal seed disks from the world's food bank, Varik is forced to put his dreams of becoming a doctor on hold

                        venture with her, into a hot zone teeming with treacherous nomads and a Fireseed cult who worships his dead

                        a globally overcooked and devastated Earth divided into three sociopolitical regions: the Hotzone, where
                        burn-scarred
                        workers struggle to survive in 160 degree temperatures; Land Dominion, where realtor Melvyn Baron builds an
                        empire
                        by
                        exploiting the Hotzone and its people; and Ocean Dominion, where newly orphaned teen hero Varik Teitur runs a

                        sea

                        into
                        Varik's farm, his crops are poisoned and humanity's food supply is imperiled. Cardboard characters Varik and

                        eternal
                        summers and encroaching sea level. The inhabitants have been split into two castes: the well-off ten percent are
                        known
                        as Sweet while the wretched ninety percent are known as Swill. The Sweet live precariously in middle-class
                        suburbs,
                        never knowing if their luck will continue; while the Swill are jammed into enormous, barely maintained high

                      <li>Unrelenting drought has transfigured Southern California into a surreal, phantasmagoric landscape. With the
                        Central
                        Valley barren, underground aquifer drained, and Sierra snowpack entirely depleted, most “Mojavs,” prevented by
                        both
                        armed vigilantes and an indifferent bureaucracy from freely crossing borders to lusher regions, have allowed
                        themselves to be evacuated to internment camps. In Los Angeles’ Laurel Canyon, two young Mojavs—Luz, once a
                        poster
                        child for the Bureau of Conservation and its enemies, and Ray, a veteran of the “forever war” turned
                        surfer—squat
                        in a
                        starlet’s abandoned mansion. Holdouts, they subsist on rationed cola and whatever they can loot, scavenge, and
                        improvise.The couple’s fragile love somehow blooms in this arid place, and for the moment, it seems enough. But
                        when
                        they cross paths with a mysterious child, the thirst for a better future begins. They head east, a route strewn
                        with
                        danger: sinkholes and patrolling authorities, bandits and the brutal, omnipresent sun. Ghosting after them are
                        rumors
                        of a visionary dowser—a diviner for water—and his followers, who whispers say have formed a colony at the edge
                        of
                        a
                        mysterious sea of dunes. Immensely moving, profoundly disquieting, and mind-blowingly original, Watkins’s novel
                        explores the myths we believe about others and tell about ourselves, the double-edged power of our most
                        cherished
                        relationships, and the shape of hope in a precarious future that may be our own.</li>
