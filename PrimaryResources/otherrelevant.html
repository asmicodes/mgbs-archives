                  <li>In this brilliant, essential book, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Thomas L. Friedman speaks to America's urgent
                    need
                    for national renewal and explains how a green revolution can bring about both a sustainable environment and a
                    sustainable America. Friedman explains how global warming, rapidly growing populations, and the expansion of the
                    world’s middle class through globalization have produced a dangerously unstable planet--one that is "hot, flat,
                    and
                    crowded." In this Release 2.0 edition, he also shows how the very habits that led us to ravage the natural world
                    led
                    to the meltdown of the financial markets and the Great Recession. Friedman proposes that an ambitious national
                    strategy—which he calls “Geo-Greenism”—is not only what we need to save the planet from overheating; it is what
                    we
                    need to make America healthier, richer, more innovative, more productive, and more secure. The challenge of a
                    sustainable way of life presents the United States with an opportunity not only to rebuild its economy, but to
                    lead
                    the world in radically innovating toward cleaner energy. And it could inspire Americans to something we haven't
                    seen
                    in a long time--nation-building in America--by summoning the intelligence, creativity, and concern for the
                    common
                    good
                    that are our greatest national resources.</li>

                  <li>#1 bestseller, winner of the Hilary Weston Writers' Trust Prize for Non-Fiction, and Naomi Klein's most
                    important
                    book yet--about the economic drivers that are warming our planet and how the climate crisis can yet spur
                    economic,
                    cultural and political transformation. Klein argues that our current growth-based economic model is waging war
                    on
                    the
                    life support systems of our planet. Using phenomenal research, she lays out why climate change is not an
                    "issue"--it
                    is a civilizational wake-up call, a powerful message delivered in the language of fires, floods, storms and
                    droughts.
                    Klein attacks the dominant economic policies of deregulated capitalism and endless resource extraction, and
                    brilliantly identifies the threads that connect our failed responses to the crisis--from hard-core climate
                    deniers
                    to
                    celebrity billionaires with messiah complexes, to the reckless quest to engineer the planet--and she reveals how
                    the
                    "Big Green" environmental organizations may be hurting more than helping. She argues that we urgently need an
                    entirely
                    new model of human progress and shows why climate change--with its full economic and moral implications
                    understood--is
                    the most powerful weapon we have ever had in the fight for equality and social justice. Tracing the rise of a
                    bold
                    new
                    resistance movement against extreme energy, she highlights the real solutions emerging in the rubble of our
                    failed
                    systems--solutions that require us to break virtually every rule in the free-market playbook. The climate change
                    debate is about to get a lot hotter.</li>

                  <li>Elizabeth Kolbert's environmental classic Field Notes from a Catastrophe first developed out of a
                    groundbreaking,
                    National Magazine Award-winning three-part series in The New Yorker. She expanded it into a still-concise yet
                    richly
                    researched and damning book about climate change: a primer on the greatest challenge facing the world today.But
                    in
                    the
                    years since, the story has continued to develop; the situation has become more dire, even as our understanding
                    grows.
                    Now, Kolbert returns to the defining book of her career. She has added a chapter bringing things up-to-date on
                    the
                    existing text, plus three new chapters--on ocean acidification, the tar sands, and a Danish town that's gone
                    carbon
                    neutral--making it, again, a must-read for our moment. Long known for her insightful and thought-provoking
                    political
                    journalism, author Elizabeth Kolbert now tackles the controversial and increasingly urgent subject of global
                    warming.
                    In what began as groundbreaking three-part series in the New Yorker, for which she won a National Magazine Award
                    in
                    2006, Kolbert cuts through the competing rhetoric and political agendas to elucidate for Americans what is
                    really
                    going on with the global environment and asks what, if anything, can be done to save our planet. Now updated and
                    with
                    a new afterword, Field Notes from a Catastrophe is the book to read on the defining issue and greatest challenge
                    of
                    our times.</li>

                  <li>Reissued on the tenth anniversary of its publication, this classic work on our environmental crisis features a
                    new
                    introduction by the author, reviewing both the progress and ground lost in the fight to save the earth. This
                    impassioned plea for radical and life-renewing change is today still considered a groundbreaking work in
                    environmental
                    studies. McKibben’s argument that the survival of the globe is dependent on a fundamental, philosophical shift
                    in
                    the
                    way we relate to nature is more relevant than ever. McKibben writes of our earth’s environmental cataclysm,
                    addressing
                    such core issues as the greenhouse effect, acid rain, and the depletion of the ozone layer. His new introduction
                    addresses some of the latest environmental issues that have risen during the 1990s. The book also includes an
                    invaluable new appendix of facts and figures that surveys the progress of the environmental movement. More than
                    simply
                    a handbook for survival or a doomsday catalog of scientific prediction, this classic, soulful lament on Nature
                    is
                    required reading for nature enthusiasts, activists, and concerned citizens alike.

                  <li>Evenmere, the High House, a Victorian mansion of infinite size, is the mechanism that runs the universe; the
                    lamps
                    must be lit or the stars fail; the clocks must be wound lest Time cease; the Balance between Order and Chaos

                    is
                    too late, the strange rules of the house; he must travel its winding corridors and secret passages to the myriad
                    countries lying within its walls. He has little time to act; the Anarchists are seizing control of the house;
                    the
                    Gnawlings are massing; the Black River is rising; the Eternity Clock is running down. His actions will determine

                  <li>There are zeppelins over South Kensington and boat people in the South Atlantic. Among them are Emily and
                    daughter
                    Jenny, travelling south to safety and a reunion with John, who has gone ahead to find work. They travel with
                    Browning,
                    a sailor who has already saved their lives more than once. In the slang of their post-melt world, Emily and
                    Jenny
                    are
                    refugees known as ‘mangoes’, a corruption of the saying ‘man go south’. At heart a book about climate change,
                    it's
                    also, says White, "a kind of alternative history of publishing in extremis, examples of the apparent human
                    necessity
                    of finding new ways to tell and share stories, and how the future of writing, publishing and reading might need
                    to
                    be
                    as much in the low-tech past as the hi-tech present".</li>
