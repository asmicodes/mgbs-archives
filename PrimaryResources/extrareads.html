                  <li>Pressia barely remembers the Detonations or much about life during the Before. In her sleeping cabinet behind
                    the
                    rubble of an old barbershop where she lives with her grandfather, she thinks about what is lost -
                    how the world
                    went
                    from amusement parks, movie theaters, birthday parties, fathers and mothers . . . to ash and dust, scars,
                    permanent
                    burns, and fused, damaged bodies. And now, at an age when everyone is required to turn themselves over to the
                    militia
                    to either be trained as a soldier or, if they are too damaged and weak, to be used as live targets, Pressia can
                    no
                    longer pretend to be small. Pressia is on the run.
            
                    Burn a Pure and Breathe the Ash . . .
                    There are those who escaped the apocalypse unmarked. Pures. They are tucked safely inside the Dome that protects
                    their
                    healthy, superior bodies. Yet Partridge, whose father is one of the most influential men in the Dome, feels
                    isolated
                    and lonely. Different. He thinks about loss-maybe just because his family is broken; his father is emotionally
                    distant; his brother killed himself; and his mother never made it inside their shelter. Or maybe it's his
                    claustrophobia: his feeling that this Dome has become a swaddling of intensely rigid order. So when a slipped
                    phrase
                    suggests his mother might still be alive, Partridge risks his life to leave the Dome to find her.
            
                    When Pressia meets Partridge, their worlds shatter all over again.</li>

                  <li>The world has no air. If you want to survive, you pay to breathe. But what if you can't? And what if you think
                    everything could be different? Three teens will leave everything they know behind in Sarah Crossan's gripping
                    and
                    original dystopian teen novel of danger, longing, and glimmering hope.
            
                    Ever since the Switch, when the oxygen levels plummeted and most of humanity died, the survivors have been
                    protected
                    in glass domes full of manufactured air. Protected . . . or trapped? Or controlled? Alina's a revolutionary who
                    believes we can save the environment. Quinn's a Premium who's never had to worry about having enough air. His
                    best
                    friend, Bea, is an Auxiliary who's never worried about anything but having enough air. When the three cross
                    paths,
                    they will change everything.</li>
