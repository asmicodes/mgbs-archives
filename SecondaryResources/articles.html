                    <div class="annotation">This text focuses on why YA Dystopian and post-apocalypse texts should be taught in schools, and how exposing students to such texts benefits their understanding of the world and politics. Alfes and her team demonstrate the benefits of including YA post-apocalypse and dystopian texts in secondary school curriculums through four case studies. Teachers noticed that the implementation of such texts had the potential of improving language efficiency in students, the texts were versatile and opened intercultural discussion amongst students, thereby broadening their knowledge on thematic ideologies, and exposure to the texts also improved students’ critical thinking skills. This text offers insight into the ways YA literature can be used in academic settings, and how forming an educational framework that targets discussion on climate change through these novels can help improve student engagement on the matter. As demonstrated through the case studies, YA literature has the capacity to not only engage students’ in topics about climate change but to also push them into feeling concern for their planet. As such, understanding ways in which this genre neglects to forefront issues of climate change, and merging it with educational curriculums can help format a potential framework to better connect students with the environment.</div>

The essay focuses on how “[q]uality young adult literature can provide a vehicle for facilitating the exploration of community, its role in young people’s lives, and adolescents’ place within it” (55). In each summary, Anderson, Goldsworthy, and MacQueen focus on elements that the text offers in relation to adolescent identity. In Ship Breaker, for instance, they highlight how morality, interrelationships, and social class differences are few of the many themes evident in the narrative. Ultimately, the essay highlights how young readers can learn and build their own identities through the way the character grows. This essay offers a quick look into the potential ways YA literature can be taught to students in order to forefront complex and intersectional issues such as climate change, or race. By focusing curriculums or conversations on specific themes that are highlighted in the article, youth can better connect with their environment can develop their understanding of complex real-world issues.

                      curriculums. Using three class examples, the authors demonstrate the ways in which students engage in critical
                      thinking skills as they are exposed to complex themes and ideas within the narrative. By encouraging students to
                      ask and imagine “what if,” scenarios students can partake in better understanding themes such as death, class,
                      race, and nature, and partake in imagining possible futures that can answer these questions. This paper will be
                      particularly helpful in highlighting the potential benefits of using speculative fiction as a way to teach younger
                      demographic about climate change. By implementing texts that pertain to the problem of climate change in school
                      curriculums, students can more actively partake in discussion about the issue. Students can use the narrative to
                      understand the potential impacts of climate change and feel more motivated to become active political agents in

                      to teenagers. He explains that in his own novel, Ship Breaker, he wanted “to illuminate the sort of world that we
                      adults are handing off to [youth].” Bacigalupi highlights the necessity of being truthful to teenagers who know
                      that they will “inherit a world significantly depleted and damaged.” He contends that by teaching youth about the
                      world through fiction, they will be better equipped and more passionate about preventing their world from further
                      deterioration. In this way, YA speculative fiction offers youth the ability to not only learn about real world
                      issues, but to form a personal understanding of the consequences that these issues may result in. Utilizing YA
                      speculative fiction as a tool to better warn and advise the teenage demographic about the realities of climate
                      change, for instance, would be vital in combatting the effects of climate change. Centralizing issues on climate
                      change will not only reinforce awareness amongst teenagers but might offer a platform to motivate activism in the
                      future. This text reinstates the importance and influence of the genre in creating political identity within
                      youth.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Brisman tackles the subject of climate change in children’s book. He begins by outlining the
                      history of climate change and its growing prominence in the present world. After reinforcing the growing imminence
                      of climate change, and outlining the potential and current effects we are seeing because of it. Brisman then
                      examines the implications of excluding children from the political realm who he argues will “experience the
                      adverse cultural, economic, environmental and social impacts of climate change in qualitatively different,
                      disproportional, and worse ways than adults” (264). He contends that increasing “[c]hildren’s engagement with
                      environmental concerns” have reduced desensitization in adults and motivates them to become more environmentally
                      active (269). Through analyses of various children stories, including “Green Santa,” he demonstrates the problems
                      in the way climate change is presented to children. He considers the effects of romanticizing, if not entirely
                      neglecting, topics of climate change in children’s narratives. His analysis highlights the importance of
                      recognizing youth as a political participant. Moreover, his work outlines ways in which political agendas have
                      skewed the way climate change is presented in texts. His analysis would be helpful in determining the ways climate
                      change is presented in YA literature, as well as the importance of finding identity within and through nature.

                    <div class="annotation">In this article, Noel discusses how capitalism has progressed over the ages, and how this
                      has led to the current impending economic collapse. Using four theorists, he examines the ways in which capitalism
                      and neoliberalism has propelled the world towards impending recession, and how this, in turn, works to
                      deprioritize issues like climate change. Noel examines whether it is possible to move into the “post-neoliberal
                      world,” and showcases that “even in neoliberalism’s heartlands, in the thick of financial crisis, there is only
                      weak impetus for change” (186). This article highlights the ways in which it has become more economically
                      beneficial to avoid discussing or funding the issue of climate change at all. Noel contends that capitalistic and
                      individualistic mindsets have overwhelmed the number needed for grassroot movements and parties to fulfill their
                      agendas, and how other factors like low social mobility, social inequality, and poverty (to name a few) have
                      inhibited progress necessary for change. Furthermore the politicization of grassroot parties, and the neglect to
                      vote for green parties has further exacerbated the issue of climate change rather than offer solutions. Noel
                      offers an economic and political framework that can be used to demonstrate the reasons why there is a lack of
                      conversation about climate change.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">This article examines the importance of posthumanism in YA post-apocalypse and dystopian
                      novels. Cerqueira argues that the post-human form challenges human/non-human binaries which is vital in order to
                      forge a connection to nature. She considers how explorations of pandemics in which “the loss of human life, the
                      paranoia caused by the fear of being infected, the struggle to find a cure, and how the infection (or the cure)
                      can alter the human body” affect literature and force readers “to rethink what it actually means to be human.”
                      Cerqueira’s analysis can be used to examine the ways in which human bodies interact with nature in the
                      post-apocalypse or dystopian world. Through her readings texts like The Maze Runner, or Wilder Girls, or The Lunar
                      Chronicles, Cerqueira showcases how the transformation of children from human to post-human allows these
                      characters to reconnect with nature and transcend what it means to be human. Transformed bodies “question and
                      dismantle the aforementioned binaries. … [and] have the power to change perceptions, to open dialogue, and to
                      unveil how powerful is the connection between human/monster, human/Other, and human/animal.” By imagining
                      identities beyond human and deconstructing what it means to be human, narratives can open space to interact with
                      the environment outside of the norm. The posthuman, she determines, is the solution to seeing and developing a
                      relationship with nature that is balanced and equitable.</div>

                      Connors and Trites use Endangered as a basis to demonstrate how climate change is an intersectional issue. The
                      authors contend that to truly understand and reconcile our connection to nature, narratives should utilize a
                      posthumanist perspective. Posthumanism challenges the inherently problematic binaries propagated by humanist
                      beliefs. The authors consider how humanist perspectives separate humans from the rest of the world by depicting
                      humans as superior, or more important than other species. Through their close reading of Endangered, Connors and
                      Trites show the ways in which posthumanism allows the protagonist to question and challenge what is deemed human

                      speculative fiction which centralizes on the oil industry. Analyzing the The Road by Cormac McCarthy and The
                      Windup Girl by Paolo Bacigalupi, Donnelly demonstrates the emerging fear of “petro-capitalism” and “the spatial
                      violence” that it has enacted on the landscape of America. Donnelly examines how the novels comment on the effects
                      of “petrotopia” in the post-apocalypse. He demonstrates how the post-petrol world reenacts the same capitalist and
                      hegemonic rule over the nation. Moreover, these novels highlight the implications of our current dependence on
                      petroleum and its connection to climate catastrophe. Donnelly contends that The Windup Girl rejects the idealistic
                      notion “that the end of oil will necessitate social and political change,” and instead “indicates how
                      neoliberalism might intensify rather than dissipate once oil is lost to the global economy, thereby maintaining
                      both political corruption and American hegemony.” Similarly, The Road depicts the internalization of
                      petro-capitalism through the father figure who resolutely continues to “perpetuate ‘the individual (male)
                      breadwinner’s own entrepreneurialism’ as the basis of meaningful existence.” In both cases, Donnelly points out
                      that the texts explore the inability to define petro-capitalism is the central problem that hinders the ability to
                      imagine the end of capitalism. Moreover, Donnelly considers the implications of an essentialist narrative where
                      accumulation and consumption of “resources as commodities” is a “fundamental dynamic of human organization”
                      prevent any change in the systems that already exist. He argues that these essentialist beliefs place all
                      accountability on human nature and neglects to consider systematic failures.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Echterling showcases the ways in which children’s literature focuses on neoliberalistic
                      individualism to tackle environmental issues. She draws out the implications of exposing children to such
                      individualistic mindset, and how this takes away from tackling the complexity of climate change. Echterling
                      acknowledges how YA dystopian literature indulges in complex conversations, but she focuses more on children’s
                      literature which she claims has a more blatant pedagogical message. This article gives insight into the ways that
                      children’s literature neglects tackling bigger issues such as consumerism and corporational accountability. As
                      such, forms of activism taught by these books are too narrow and ultimately unhelpful. Using this article,
                      arguments about how YA literature parallels or further delves into topics on climate change can be established.
                      The article outlines a framework that can be useful when analyzing YA texts, and will target more relevant topics
                      such as the political and economic causes of climate change.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Engle analyzes the political stance of the three novels, Divergent by Versonica Roth, The
                      Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, and The 5th Wave by Rick Yancey. She determines whether adult dystopian novels
                      “may actually endorse certain political ideologies in teenagers,” and that young adult dystopian literature
                      “convey[s] a liberal political ideology to teenagers.” Engle defines “conservatism” and “liberalism” in YA
                      literature using a professor of Social Sciences, Brian Farmer’s, book American Political Ideologies as a
                      foundation. She then examines the implications of YA novels increasing “levels of political engagement in
                      teenagers and caus[ing] them to identify more heavily with the Democratic party.” According to Farmer,
                      contemporary liberalism “has three major principles: a focus on government regulation of markets, increased
                      personal liberties and decreased government surveillance, and a view that every person is intrinsically equal and
                      should be treated as such.” Engle argues that these principles are evident in the three novels that she analyzes.
                      In her analysis, Engle demonstrates how the depiction of the protagonists in each book “encourage the development
                      of higher levels of general self-efficacy in teenages by providing models for development that teenagers can
                      follow.” By modeling a narrative that promotes liberal ideologies, and modeling protagonists whose journeys
                      develop their sense of self and self-identification, the novels encourage a greater identification to the
                      Democratic Party in young readers and increases political engagement. Engle emphasizes the importance of political
                      activism driven forth in young adults through YA literature. More significantly, she notes how these dystopian
                      texts offer readers a sense of self-efficacy and political power that is not necessarily established elsewhere.
                      Using her analysis, connections between low youth activism in regards to climate change can be supported.
                      Analyzing the connection between YA protagonist’s activism for climate change and reader’s engagement in
                      environmentalism might provide insight as to how conversations on climate change work, or can potentially work, in
                      YA dystopias to motivate action in youth.</div>

                      impactful narrative that drives forth activism. For this research, Goodbody’s article provides a helpful timeline
                      of the ways cli-fi has changed over the years, and how modern texts work better to establish close connections
                      with readers on the topic of discussion. His analyses, especially, showcase how texts succeed in experimenting
                      with style and disciplines, and narratives to focalize on climate change itself. Moreover, his analysis on why it
                      is vital to include intersectional perspectives on the topic of climate change supports the ways in which the

                      part in this oppression, and the political stance of the novel itself. Although the poster does not go too far in

                      Hampton focuses on neoliberalism and climate change, as well as Marxism and climate change to show how it is
                      presented academically. He then contends that by targeting trade unionships, conversations and understandings
                      about climate change could be better mitigated, and determines that a democratic political and economic mindset is
                      needed in order for this to occur. Hamptom also delves into various ways political beliefs of trade unions can be

                    <div class="annotation">Hursh and Henderson argue that neoliberalism has impeded the ability for us to create
                      alternative futures. They discuess how “neoliberalism has not provided economic benefits, nor … has it responded
                      adequately to environmental and educational issues,” and work to demonstrate “how it is that neoliberalism is
                      largely uncontested so that we can challenge neoliberal discourses and practices.” Hursh and Henderson outline how
                      neoliberalism has worked globally, using real-life examples to show how neoliberalism “has generally benefited the
                      already privileged while harming most everyone else.” In this way, because of neoliberalistic agendas, climate
                      change is not only largely ignored by the population, but it doesn’t even reach the level of educational awareness
                      that it should within nations. Consequently, resolutions towards tackling climate change, or finding alternative
                      lifestyles to slow its progression, remains unimaginable. Hursh and Henderson’s analysis of school systems is
                      especially enlightening as it highlights how curriculums are “often reduced to a narrow skills approach,” which
                      reduces students’ abilities “to respond to more complex, interdisciplinary questions.” Hursh and Henderson
                      critique the implementation of standardized testing and privitization of school systems; they contend that by
                      engaging students in questions about their worlds and the future that they imagine, as well as challenging the
                      inevitability of neoliberal marketization can help “construct new markets that actually value commonly held
                      resources and local communities.” Using this article, discourse on how YA novels are politically charged with
                      neoliberalistic beliefs, and therefore skirt around topics of climate change can be examined. The article offers
                      insight into the political landscape of climate change, and the implications of a neoliberal agenda. Its analysis
                      on how education currently is implicated in neoliberal political perspectives emphasizes the way that
                      neoliberalism pervades into younger generations. It advocates for a new, “social democratic approach” of learning,
                      governing, and teaching that allows people to step outside of neoliberalist individualism and to imagine a better
                      future.</div>

                      through YA sci-fi novels, readers can challenge the severance between nature and body and better understand the
                      consequence of losing connection with the environment. Through close readings of texts such as Invitation to the
                      Game by Monica Hughes, and Feed by M.T. Anderson, Hutton, Miller and Braithwaite demonstrate how the protagonists
                      interact with utopian and dystopian technological states, and their respective relationships with nature and
                      technology. They highlight how relationship with technology has also been a part in separating the body from
                      nature. Hutton, Miller, and Braithwaite argue that “[n]ature and the artificial are frequently constructed as
                      binaries that the young person must negotiate or resist in order to survive and preserve the future.” They
                      demonstrate how environmental dystopias depict technology “as both the saviour of earth … and, more commonly,
                      destroyer of the earth.” Young bodies in these narratives are arguably “intensive sites where the consequences of
                      the loss of the natural environment can be brought into even sharper focus.” The article analyzes young bodies in
                      the texts to show how they are vulnerable to the “salvation or destruction” of technology. It defines the
                      relationship between technology, nature, and body as complex and interconnected; the blur between technology and
                      the organic can become “a hazardous site not only for the formation of identity, but indeed, survival.” The
                      article demonstrates the contradictory and complex nature of technology and environment in these dystopias,
                      highlighting how the encroachment of artificial technology not only can lead to the “destruction or replacement of
                      natural systems,” but is also needed for the survival of life. This article will be significant to determine how
                      relationships with body, technology, and nature are depicted in YA dystopias. Hutton, Miller, and Braithwate’s
                      readings offer insight on how technology severs and connects young bodies to nature, and the implications of such
                      relationship. Moreover, through these readings, discussion as to how portrayal of body in nature, and outside of
                      nature, and its implications in terms of climate change can be further explored.</div>

                      Through the readings of the Finnish YA fiction novels: De hemlösas stad (2010 [The City of the Homeless],
                      untranslated) by Annika Luther, Jäljellä (2012 [Without a Trace, untranslated) and Toisaalla (2012 [Elsewhere],
                      untranslated) by Salla Simukka, Teemestarin kirja (2012, Memory of Water) by Emmi Itäranta, Nokkosvallankumous
                      (2013 [Nettle Revolution], untranslated) by Siiri Enoranta, and Kevätuhrit (2016 [Spring Sacrifices],
                      untranslated) by K. K. Alongi, the authors demonstrate how giving political subjectivity to young protagonists
                      allows them the freedom to challenge, and to interact with larger institutions that will affect them throughout
                      their lives. The authors claim that Finnish YA dystopia narratives “reveals collective fears over the destruction
                      of the Finnish welfare state.” They note that hope typically presides in the potential change that the next
                      generation can bring into the world. Analyzing Western YA dystopian novels, they note that “there is a long
                      tradition of seeing childhoods itself as utopian, a space and time apart from adult life and all its concerns.”
                      The authors, therefore, examine how giving young characters “strong active agency,” can bring hope to dystopian
                      futures. Through close readings of the previously listed novels, the authors inquire as to how children are
                      depicted in YA dystopias. They examine “the societal roles, freedom, societal power, and the agency of young
                      characters” in each text. They then outline how “climate and ecological themes” work in these YA novels, as well
                      as how fairytale tropes work with girlhood and female power. This article presents an international perspective on
                      youth in YA dystopias. Using this article, it could be interesting to see the ways in which the protagonists in YA
                      American novels are implicated through their political and social autonomy and obligations. Their section on
                      ecology and political agency provides insight as to how youth form their identity within nature. Moreover, their
                      readings demonstrate how depictions of youth can motivate political activism.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">This article explores the gaps and “bright spots” in cli-fi novels that elicit hope and
                      awareness amongst young readers. Through an analysis of Julie Bertagna’s Exodus trilogy, the authors work to
                      understand the emotional and intellectual response that the novels evoke about climate change in young readers,
                      and whether cli-fi is able to fulfill an interdisciplinary, educational experience for its audience. The authors
                      utilize the terms, “blank spots,” and “bright spots,” introduced in an editorial by Alan Reid, which refers to
                      areas in research about “the educational and the environmental” that “give rise to questions but not necessarily
                      answers,” and topics of research that “inspire and innovate research.” The article seeks to determine the “blank
                      spots” in cli-fi novels in hopes that it will lead to them becoming “bright spots.” Through a case study in which
                      groups of students (10-12 years) were asked to investigate and reflect on “representations related to nature,
                      climate change, and sustainability” in the trilogy, the authors utilize young voices to “[rethink] the role of
                      literature in education.” Through their case-study, the authors confirmed that young readers “are likely to
                      recognize themselves in” the protagonist and form their own identities and emotions related to climate change. The
                      depiction of apocalypse and the depiction of human destruction also worked “as a call to action in the present.”
                      The study found that education for sustainable development requires a more critical and intersectional
                      understanding of economic, social, and cultural issues. Traditional methods of teaching, they argue, is not
                      adequate in tackling complex socio-political issues, and hinder students’ abilities to recognize how it affects
                      their current lives. Leavenworth and Manni highlight the importance of using YA texts in education, and the
                      potential that it has to develop students’ learning about the current state of the world.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Analyzing and comparing Zenith and Exodus by Julianna Bartenga, Lyngstad shows how the
                      worlds and environment in both novels offer insight into a world devastated by climate change. Lyngstad examines
                      how the “novels’ focus on environmental issues” through the depiction of nature and culture binary. She argues
                      that the “nature/culture dualism is discussed in relation to another dualism, namely, that of utopia and
                      dystopia.” Using an ecocritical lens, Lyngstad shows how the novels “link utopia to nature, especially the rural
                      pastoral, and dystopia to culture, especially urbanism and technology.” The article offers a close reading of the
                      two novels where she contrasts and compares the two different utopian/dystopian worlds (Zenith, a pastoral,
                      natural world) and Exodus (technological, synthetic world). Her readings outline the ways Zenith and Exodus
                      overlap, how they differ, what they offer to the main characters, and the implications that both worlds present.
                      Lygnstad determines the ways in which both these worlds strive to be non-exploitative, and how this plays an
                      important part in creating better imagined futures.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Mackenthun argues that “[a]n overabundance” of ecological catastrophes hinders the
                      possibility of being able to imagine a “non-violent and non-disastrous process” against the potential disaster.
                      Disaster films and literature, she argues add an element of fantasy to the situation of climate change that is not
                      conducive to encouraging social change. Readers and viewers get caught up in the underlying conspiracies causing
                      the issue in the first place, which reduces the gravity of climate change in reality, or elicits anxiety, fear and
                      defeatist mindsets. However, she argues that “transition stories” that focus on rebuilding worlds “in the midst of
                      crisis” offer ideas for change that is socially and ecologically responsible. Analyzing texts such as the Parable
                      novels by Octavia Butler and The Ministry for the Future by Kim Stanley, Mackenthun demonstrates how novels that
                      are in the midst of ecological disaster, or transitioning into ecological disaster, present more opportunities to
                      discuss preventative alternatives and solutions. Literature that depicts transition states offer a future that is
                      not already set in stone, thereby allowing readers to imagine a future that has the potential to be changed and
                      bettered. Mackenthum’s analysis presents the ways in which the texts frame ecological disaster and how characters
                      work in a collaborative manner to alleviate the situation. Her sections on “Spirituality as a Source of Power,”
                      and “Intellectual Resilience through Education” showcase how education, art, and spirituality are important
                      elements of human survival. She offers an insightful close-reading of various YA cli-fi texts to show how and what
                      potential non-exploitative alternatives can look like in the face of disaster.</div>

                      global warming. They argue that the current political framework neglects indulging in conversations about global
                      warming. Using real life examples, Fustes and Kurtz demonstrate how there are no socio-economical laws or
                      guidelines, nor are there well-educated politicians on the topic of climate change to be able to acknowledge the
                      issue let alone find solutions to take preventative action. Sciemocracy is a political structure that they offer
                      which provides a framework dedicated to mitigating and preventing “imminent world-wide disaster.” Fustes and Kurtz
                      offer an in-depth analysis on the social, economic, and cultural factors that play a part in the way global
                      warming has been defined and presented to us now. Their article offers a timeline that outlines how politics have

                    <div class="annotation">This article challenges the political undertones of the term “climate change” and how
                      postcolonial backgrounds exclude local citizens from proposed solutions. Mikulewicz contends that the term climate
                      change, similar to gender equality, is adapted to fit the agendas of businesses and politics. Using a case study
                      on Sāo Tomé and Prıncipe (STP), this article outlines how adaption of the definition of climate change implicates
                      the project to tackle climate change in the Global South. The case study works to show who is neglected and who
                      the project benefits. It ultimately seeks to determine how climate change could be understood in a way that is
                      advantageous to everyone. Mikulewicz considers the securitization of climate change, in which the definition
                      adapted and became a global threat, provoking an increase in apocalyptic depictions of the impending end of the
                      world. He considers the confliction in understanding climate change as “an imminent, global threat to humanity as
                      a whole” while learning that it does not affect everyone equally. Sections on the term “discursive violence” and
                      the implication of adaption emphasizes how vulnerable subjects are removed of their agency and disadvantaged by
                      proposed solutions. Utilizing these analyses in YA literature might challenge the way climate change is not only
                      being portrayed but how certain areas and groups that are marginalized in these fictional depictions are affected
                      by the way the term has been defined. Furthermore, challenging the adaptions of the term climate change in YA
                      literature might shed light on how the topic can be reworked to include marginalized and vulnerable peoples.</div>

                      impact on climate change. Mirowski, Walker, and Abboud argue that the left is “paralyzed by climate change”
                      because it has “conflated neoliberalism with neoclassical economics” and has used denialism as a way to finance
                      the carbon cycle. The authors contend that by propagating geoengineering as the only other alternative to tackle
                      the issue of climate change, neoliberal agendas have successfully benefited from the issue. The biggest conflation
                      that Mirowski notes is between the market and nature. When nature fails, the left chalks it up to market failure,
                      and this is the reason we are not seeing proper social activism against climate change. Understanding climate
                      change in this way hinders us from asking questions that economics has no answer for. Neoliberalists believe that
                      nature is incomprehensible and non-linear. They say that new markets must be formed in the face of market failure,
                      and that the market knows the best course of action. This is why denialists stand against scientists who speak for
                      the greater good, because neoliberalists believe that no human can understand the extent of climate change.
                      Mirowski, Walker, and Abboud debunk neoliberal thought when they point out why carbon trading and geoengineering
                      will not properly tackle the effects of climate change. The authors bring forth reasons as to how neoliberalist
                      thought only benefits the market and the implications of how climate change is presented to the general
                      population. They conclude by reconsidering what “economy” means and its role in climate change. The article
                      contends that the best way to truly initiate social change is to look for policies outside of neoliberalist
                      thought. This article critiques neoliberalist agenda when it comes to climate change. It talks about the
                      implications of climate change being defined under neoliberalist perspective and how that can affect what is not
                      being spoken about. When considering the gaps in climate change literature and the portrayal of climate change in
                      YA literature, analyzing the politics of the term might determine why there is an absence.</div>

                      Pirzadeh determines how YA dystopian novels incorporate the topic of environmentalism in a nuanced way that is
                      still accessible to young readers. She explains how the two texts utilize “enlightened anthromorphism” which
                      advocates for a nonexploitative relationship with the environment. Pirzadeh’s analysis discusses how YA literature
                      can challenge traditional views on climate change and teach young populations of readers an alternative perception
                      of their selves within nature. Moreover, it can help motivate them to form non-exploitative identities with
                      nature. She highlights how “ecodystopian novels” are abundant platforms for raising awareness about the
                      environment. Pirzadeh’s section on ecopolitics demonstrates the ways in which neoliberalist thought and capitalist
                      agendas skew with our understanding of nature. Her analysis builds further on how politics influence YA narratives
                      and how they are, in turn, affecting young readers. By teaching young readers to analyze text using an
                      ecopolitical lens can help counteract the internalization of neoliberal influence. Furthermore, she contends,
                      incorporating ecopolitics can teach young readers about the complexity and intersectionality of climate change.
                      Utilizing ecodystopian novels will teach youth how to be aware of their own consumeristic habits as well as the
                      larger political hand in its exacerbation.</div>

                      source of refuge and safety for the protagonist, and how the implementation of technology works with and in
                      nature. Setyorini points out the ways in which adult, authoritative leaders use nature “as a force” wherein nature
                      is “an antagonistic space,” which showcases how humanism separates the self from nature and its implications. On
                      the contrary, her sections on the ways in which Katniss from The Hunger Games and Tris from Divergent form their
                      identity through nature demonstrates shows how nature is also used as a space to reconcile and develop agency
                      within female characters. It might be worth examining the implications of paralleling adolescent growth and female
                      subjectivity to nature. Using her analysis, questions as to how youth is utilized to reforge a connection to
                      nature, how youth can become the potential posthuman who redefines and shapes nature as nature shapes them, and
                      the ways in which gender plays a part in its connection to nature can be further challenged.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Sharp analyzes how law is used and transformed in dystopian fiction comics. She focuses on
                      the comic series From Above by creator Craig Bruyn to demonstrate how the depiction of law and justice (and its
                      failures) works in conjunction to current socio-political anxieties, and how law and justice also work to mediate
                      these fears. In her analysis, she shows how the political collapse in the dystopian world in From Above not only
                      warns readers of the consequences of real-life social crises but offers a narrative of hope. Sharp’s reading of
                      the failure of the law and how it separates the people from the law can be generalized into how the law neglects
                      or transforms terminologies like climate change as well. Her argument about how dystopian fiction provide a
                      framework of hope which “offers significant transformative potential” can be used to support how YA literature
                      presents a line of redemption and how that can evoke social change. Sharp’s readings on neoliberal law and how the
                      narrative advocates for social change is particularly relevant to how neoliberalism alters understanding of
                      climate change, and how it has systematically neglected to take the proper course of action needed to tackle the
                      issue. Lastly, using her examination of the how themes of hope advocate for social change can be further
                      considered in readings of YA fiction. How does a medium that does not include visuals promote social activism in
                      readers? How does the depiction of the justice system in YA literature work and connect with climate change?
                      Moreover, how can YA literature make the complex and nuanced relationship between law, justice, and climate change
                      more accessible for its readers so that it is not only an institution that is feared and must be overthrown, but
                      rather it offers an opportunity to be reshaped and redeemed?</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Schneider-Mayerson timelines the history of cli-fi and climate change as it is represented
                      in fiction throughout the years. He contends that cli-fi is a category rather than a genre on its own that depicts
                      “the ongoing struggle to safeguard a livable climate for our species and millions of others,” and inspires readers
                      to understand their own culpability in the matter. His section on denial, avoidism, and acceptance considers the
                      importance of texts that portray the implications of denial and avoidance of climate change. Using examples of
                      texts such as Carbon Dreams by Susan Gaines, Flight Behavior by Barbara Kingsolver, and State of Fear by Michael
                      Crichton, Schneider-Mayerson examines how the “hybrid realism” of these texts showcase “the mediation of climate
                      change through science and culture and its apperception through the intersectional categories of nationality,
                      socioeconomic conditions, and ideology” (313). He then considers whether fiction is truly able to inspire
                      collective political action for there to be any change. He argues that cli-fi post-apocalypse and dystopian
                      fiction do not effectively inspire political action because readers are too familiar with apocalyptic tropes.
                      Desensitization to the end of the world narratives make it easy for audience to ignore the content that is being
                      challenged and pointed out. Finally, he examines texts such as The Earth Party by George Marshall, Daniel Kramb’s
                      From Here, and Kim Stanley Robinson’s Science in the Capital sci-fi trilogy to show how texts that examine
                      possible political frameworks to tackle climate change, or imagine futures that can be improved might actually
                      motivate readers to become politically active. Schneider-Mayerson concludes by examining two emerging themes:
                      transition to a life after oil, and climate injustice. This article is particularly helpful because it outlines
                      texts that indulge in conversations about climate change. His section on eco-politics and the future of cli-fi is
                      significant in determining the direction of future research on the subject. His conversation on the new emerging
                      themes shed light on the potential of fiction literature successfully motivating political action on behalf of
                      audiences and placing culpability on greater corporational power structures.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Shrubsole argues that the free-market capitalism and new branch of neoliberalist perception
                      on climate change is hindering progress towards building a solution. He outlines how neoliberalist policies began
                      and how neoliberal political parties have used connections to narrow their perception about climate change.
                      Although the standpoint is no longer that climate change does not exist, neoliberalist have started branding
                      climate change as an issue that human beings must and should adapt to. As such, political parties have formed a
                      belief that the expenditure towards adaptation procedures should be prioritized over management or reduction
                      procedures. This belief system just goes to show how neoliberalists have taken the relationship between the
                      economy and market and transferred it to the relationship between humans and the biosphere. He argues that this
                      line of thought disregards emotional connection to the environment and the effects it will have on lower-class
                      citizens. Neoliberalist claims that climate change can be reversed through geoengineering or that adaptation
                      (molding the world to fit our needs as climate change occurs) is a cheaper alternative, Shrubsole argues, is
                      illogical. Shrubsole then offers an alternative perspective by pointing out how historically traditional
                      conservative parties have voiced and acted on the need to protect the earth. He argues that highlighting this line
                      of thought in which all people should work as a collective to finance and, at the very least, manage the effects
                      of climate change, should be a priority. The government needs to push forward laws and policies that double down
                      on corporational and industrial pollution as well as finance groups and parties that work to build infrastructure
                      that will weather the changing environment. Shrubsole concludes that in order to fight climate change, hope is
                      important, and that fatalism is only an excuse that prevents action. He reiterates that neoliberalism has clung to
                      the wrong ideals and that following it will only further exacerbate the situation that we are already in. His
                      article is particularly helpful in understanding neoliberalism and its influence on climate change. His arguments
                      on alternative frameworks to tackle climate change can be helpful with determining how YA novels should portray a
                      better present in their narratives that can avoid catastrophes in the future.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">This article delves into the effects of neoliberal agendas on health and climate change.
                      Sparke demonstrates how the roots of neoliberalism pits humans as “molecular frontiers for capitalist growth,” and
                      how its political structure “materialize[s] as structural violence on the poor.” The section on how neoliberalism
                      has adopted an “adaptive” political framework to tackle climate change offers insight into the complex way this
                      also targets lower-class citizens. Sparke contends that through neoliberalist policies, issues such as climate
                      change and health have become individualized which removes accountability from markets and businesses. He
                      showcases how health and climate change are invariably interconnected. His example of factory farming, for
                      instance, highlights the damaging approach of the mass-market not only for the climate, but also for the health of
                      workers and animals. Sparkes’ article is an enlightening resource that lists real-world evidence of how
                      neoliberalism is failing as a political structure. His explanation of how neoliberalism is sold globally offers
                      great insight into the way neoliberalism controls all aspects of life including mortality. The article presents a
                      foundational understanding of neoliberalism and the intersectional approach needed to understand climate change.
                      The full book also presents in-depth analysis of the effects of neoliberalism on the world. Part IV on “Natures
                      and Environments” will also be a considerably helpful resource to understand the hand neoliberalism has on the
                      understanding of climate change.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Spencer focuses on the term “Anthropocene” to examine the relation between human, non-human,
                      and nature in climate fiction literature. She delves into the implication of humanist thought in which man
                      (specifically, European men) were historically seen as superior to nature. The quest to conquer space in nature
                      reinforced the separation between man and nature and resulted in the distinction between “natural history and
                      human history,” which is no longer possible under the lens of the Anthropocene. Spencer outlines how present
                      theories of nature and human co-existing in relation to one another has opened a new understanding about the
                      world. Spencer then analyzes how YA literature has embodied a humanist perception when it reuses the hero trope in
                      which one protagonist undergoes a series of obstacles and challenges, and ultimately succeeds in his/her goal. She
                      discusses the implication of such humanist “truths” which, she argues, are evidently “limiting.” She contends that
                      YA quest narratives reinforce humanist beliefs that separate human from nature or emphasize the distinction
                      between human v. other binaries. Exploring and analyzing multiple texts such as The Raven cycle, Spencer
                      demonstrates how this binary between human v nature takes away from current understanding of nature. She argues
                      that YA literature that explores the Anthropocene offers a better understanding of our world. Viewing natural
                      space as the Anthropocene reduces the human v nature binary into something more complex and relational to one
                      another because it further connects the protagonist to the environmental space that he/she is in. Sparke comments
                      that: “The depiction of relational space in the text’s primary worlds is important for suggesting the productive
                      possibility of moving away from the dominant ontologies in response to the climate crisis.” Sparke then
                      demonstrates the ways in which the Raven Cycle opens up room for interpretation and steps away from humanist
                      perspectives when it includes multiple narratives and histories, strays away from the hero trope and rejects the
                      portrayal of a single hero character. Nature is deemed unpredictable, untameable, and time is relational, further
                      perpetuating the ideology that it will take a collective and collaborative approach to be a part of the
                      Anthropocene.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">In her analysis of The Carbon Diaries 2015 and 2017 by Saci Lloyd, Von Mossner demonstrates
                      how themes of uptopian hope offer young readers the ability to imagine an ecotopian future. She claims that as a
                      critical eco-dystopia, The Carbon Diaries demonstrates how “personal engagement and hard work, and bringing about
                      a better world is a political process driven by hope and desire” (71). As such, these books are able to “warn
                      young adult readers about the future while mobilizing them into action” (71). Von Mossner begins by outlining the
                      contradiction inherent in YA post-apocalypse narratives. She considers the benefits and downfalls of including a
                      hopeful ending in these narratives, and ultimately demonstrates how ambiguity of climate change in the
                      post-apocalypse world offer readers the ability to experience and understand the responsibility that “rests in the
                      hands of their generation” (73). Following the trajectory of protagonist, Laura’s, life, Von Mossner shows how the
                      coming-of-age trope coincides with growing political activism. Although Laura initially began reluctant to partake
                      in politics, ultimately, as is seen in the sequel, she realizes that her growth, identity and survival is
                      interwoven with nature and the rest of the political world. In this way, Laura learns the importance of being a
                      politically active figure. Von Mossner demonstrates how Laura’s journey can be internalized and mirrored by young
                      adult readers who can empathize and understand Laura’s position.</div>

                      intersectional topics such as class, race, politics and their relation to climate change helped students better

                      countries like Mexico face a “double exposure” where “small farmers in the South are subjected [to] climate change
                      and the pressures of globalization (including neoliberalism and structural adjustment).” The first and second
                      sections of this article focus on how climate change and “stresses of neoliberal globalization” affect small
                      farmers and drought-stricken areas of Mexico. The third section, then delves into the role of neoliberalism in
                      “promo[ting] climate change.” Wilson examines how neoliberal agendas plays a large part in exacerbating climate
                      change migration by inadvertently targeting vulnerable people. This article delves into the circular relationship
                      between socioeconomic downfall caused by climate change, and the lack of protection of poor communities. Wilson
                      highlights how people in the poorer nations are often neglected in neoliberal agendas and outlines what the
                      effects of such systematic exclusions are. The article also discusses why and how neoliberalism propagates
                      behaviour that magnifies climate change. Her findings can be especially useful in determining how climate change
                      is depicted in YA literature. Wilson’s analysis showcases the intersectionality of climate change and the politics
                      that influence potential preventative strategies to alleviate the issue. By demonstrating how certain groups are
                      also politically targeted she also raises a vital question that considers how our current understanding of climate
                      change is lacking.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Wolk considers the way English literature is being taught to adolescent students. He
                      believes that by curating a curriculum that exposes young adults to texts and activities that discuss global and
                      political issues will “help young adults shape their civic identities and develop their civic courage” (666). He
                      lists various texts that challenge and indulge in conversations such as environmental literacy, or global
                      awareness. Wolk then outlines his curriculum to demonstrate how texts can be potentially taught to better
                      students’ learning. Using Black and White by Volponi, Wolk builds a lesson plan that highlights issues such as
                      social responsibility, economic class, and race. He demonstrates how teaching texts using open-ended questions can
                      help students better engage with the topic and connect it with their present-day lives. Wolk discusses teachers’
                      responsibility to teach students about their social and political world, and to motivate them to be political
                      actors in their own worlds. He emphasizes the importance of books as a resource to connect and teach students
                      empathy about the world, and to be able to imagine a better future.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">This article talks about the colonization of the Anthropocene and the neglect of topics of
                      race in post-apocalypse literature. Xausa contends that “literary representations of climate change can be
                      complicit in producing hegemonic strands of Anthropocene discourse … de-emphasizing moral responsibilities” (88).
                      Through her analysis of The Marrow Thieves by Cherie Dimaline, Xausa argues that the novel casts “a new light on
                      the relationship between climate change, colonial and neo-colonial violence and structural inequalities generated
                      by intersecting systems of oppression” and “amplifies the marginalized and forgotten experiences of those who are
                      already experiencing the climate apocalypse” (81). In her analysis, Xausa highlights how the novel makes clear
                      that the ecological crisis is not simply “a hostile nature … retaliating against human beings” but is instead a
                      “neocolonistic and capitalistic logic” that turns “habitats, environments and bodies into resources to be
                      subjugated, transformed and exploited” (93). She demonstrates how the narrative connects the present dystopian
                      world to the past exploitation of Indigenous lands and peoples, which emphasizes the circular relationship of
                      “past and current traumas” (94). In this way, Xausa argues that the novel shows how the past is not only repeating
                      itself but is fundamentally interwoven with what is occurring currently in politics regarding climate change. She
                      considers the threat of slow violence and the impact of climate change on people who have already lost lands,
                      languages, and culture. Ultimately, Xausa determines how this survival story sheds light on the marginalized and
                      invisible people who are already facing the effects of climate change.</div>
