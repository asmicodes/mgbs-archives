                    <div class="annotation">Chattopadhyay’s review of “Apocalyptic Projections: A Study of Past Predictions, Current Trends and Future Intimations as Related to Film and Literature” focuses on how the author, Anette Magid, outlines the freedom that YA apocalypse fiction offers for imagining alternative futures. Although this article is not directly connected to the topic of climate change, it does provide an alternative intersectional framework that can be used to examine reasons and potential resolutions for the issue. For instance, Magid’s analysis of culture and eugenics (or definition of what it means to be human) can be used to examine the ways in which the posthuman might play a part in understanding issues of climate change. Essays such as Julian Cornell’s “Getting the Doomsday We Deserve: Rolan Emmerich’s 2012 and the Neoliberal Disaster Film” provide an “ambitious … attempt to couple themes of climate change disaster film with eroding American economic hegemony.” This essay focuses on how “the American disaster film is inherently conservative, even when it invokes the wider globe,” which “provides a useful if indirect insight into the changing face of sf as a genre.” Essays within the book offer insight into the issues of Western monopolies on media and narrative portrayals of the post-apocalypse, and what a potential global approach could look like. Chattopadhyay emphasizes that the “collection could have worked better with a reduced selection” but will still “make a useful companion for courses on apocalypses and dystopias.” As such, Magid’s collection of essays provide a useful foundation with various perspectives to understand the complex nature of YA narratives.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Donawerth’s review of Octavia Butler’s conversation on writing science fiction gives insight into how the genre was used to drive forth social reform. In the collection of interviews with Octavia Butler, the book “offers a good overview of the inconsistencies in Butler’s representation of herself.” Although Donaweth laments that the book is not organized chronologically and does not include oral interviews with Butler, it is still a great resource to understand Butler’s writing process. The collection gives insight as to how she uses multiple disciplines and targets multiple audiences to acknowledge and act against social injustices. Butler believes “that she views novels as ‘preaching’” and that through her novels, she can reform the human race from its “destructive biological urges.” Interviews on texts such as Kindred, or The Parable of the Sower, for instance, offer insight into how and why Butler chose to represent race, gender, and climate change the way that she did in her narratives. Understanding her intent and use of the sf genre to motivate change and action will better connect readers to the importance of narratives in terms of political action.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Gooding’s review on Jennifer Harrison’s text gives an in-depth analysis of her book. He
                      summarizes that Harrison argues how “humanism’s main task is to perform boundary work that protects the social
                      order” by keeping the environment separate from the individual, and society. Harrison analyzes various texts,
                      including Forest of Hand’s and Teeth by Carrie Ryan, and The Giver by Lois Lowry, to examine how images of
                      zombies, and dystopias utilize the depiction of “hostile, threatening, and separate” environments by creating
                      narratives and characters that “breach … the boundary between the human and the environment,” and destroy the
                      social order of humanist societies. Harrison uses these texts to showcase how they adhere “to humanist values” and
                      the implications of such adherence. Gooding, then, discusses Harrison’s second chapter which examines texts that
                      are more open to post-humanist narratives. He demonstrates how novels such as Unwind by Neal Shusterman move
                      towards a partial “posthuman ethic,” where it rejects neoliberal systems and humanist perspectives while it also
                      “affirms the value of the humanist subject within the structures of contemporary capitalism.” Harrison’s final two
                      chapters “examine dystopias that embrace the posthuman state by erasing the nature/culture divide and moving
                      beyond conventional narratives of identity formation.” According to Gooding, chapter six in particular offers a
                      “careful analysis of visual elements” in the graphic novel Decelerate Blue, and “contains some of the most
                      satisfying moments” in her book. Although Gooding deems Harrison’s book “frustrating” at times because of its
                      “tendency to buttress claims with lengthy literature reviews” and its carelessness with copyediting, he does
                      acknowledge that Harrison’s work provides a “compelling argument.” This review is helpful because it does pull out
                      certain arguments from Harrison’s text that would be especially prevalent for research on YA dystopian and
                      post-apocalypse novels and climate change. In particular, the third chapter can be used to argue the ways in which
                      humanist, capitalist mindset hinder discussion on climate change. Goodman also offers insight into where
                      Harrison’s contentions fall short, and what areas of discussion need to be further researched.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Kidd’s review of Alice Curry’s book highlights the ways in which Curry analyzes YA dystopian
                      novels using an ecofeminist and ecocritical lens: “Curry's well-researched and nicely contextualized study spans
                      an introduction, six chapters, and a conclusion, across which she treats Anglophone American, Australian, British,
                      and South African texts.” Kidd applauses Curry’s analysis on “ecothemed young adult literature.” He acknowledges
                      that she narrowed her scholarship only to Western texts, but he contends that this was an intentional decision
                      because “the western teen protagonist is especially haunted by her complicity with destructive practices.” Curry
                      close reads the following dystopian series in her book: The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, Uglies by Scott
                      Westerfield, Exodus by Julie Bertagna, Mortal Engines by Philip Reeve, and standalone novels including Feed by
                      M.T. Anderson, The Folk Keeper by Franny Billingsley, The Forest of Hands and Teeth by Carrie Ryan, and How I Live
                      Now by Meg Rosoff. Curry presents an in-depth analysis revealing how narratives are unable to separate themselves
                      from the hegemonic, colonialist powers that exist in this present day. However, she argues, the narratives do at
                      the very least challenge these powers by depicting protagonists who are ““ground[ed]” in earthly, situated and
                      empathetic values.” She brings forth the idea that this abstraction of socio-political ideas in dystopian fiction
                      allows room to reinterpret and question the forces that are imposed upon us now. This article presents some
                      relevant ideas including topics of posthumanism, poststructuralism, and ecofeminism, and its influence on
                      perceptions of politics and climate change in dystopian narratives to define and question the role of
                      “neoliberalist faith in individual ‘progress.’” Kidd’s review highlights various chapters and themes that Curry
                      uses in her analysis and summarizes her arguments in a clear and accessible manner.</div>
