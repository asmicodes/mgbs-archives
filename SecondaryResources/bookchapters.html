                    <div class="annotation">Blouin begins his book by considering the ways in which neoliberal agendas inhibit progress from preventing climate change. Chapter 8 focuses on how neoliberalism has formed a “dissonance” between the need for collective action, and “absolute freedom” (205). Using Foucault’s theory on “neoliberal schematics,” Blouin outlines how in the wake “against fascism” members of the school of thought “idolize[d] free thinkers that remain skeptical of solidarity movements,” and as such collectivism became a common antagonist (206). In the move to define neoliberalism, the term itself became ambiguous and convoluted. To this day, confusion surrounding the term has resulted in a conflict in agendas. In his analysis of The Hunger Games, Blouin shows how the trilogy “upholds a neoliberal framework under the illusion of its destruction” (208). He argues that her political journey is only a symptom of neoliberalist ideologies. He considers the implications of depicting such a government and highlights the importance of Katniss’ decision to advocate for a more holistic approach. Blouin contends that her seemingly utopian decision that acknowledges “[g]overnments will never solve the problem of power; a different kind of social arrangement must emerge,” does not separate her from neoliberal thought (210). In fact, he goes on to demonstrate how her decision reinforces individualist freedom that falls in line with neoliberalism instead of offering a collectivist solution, or an alternative framework for the future. Chapter five also argues how economics and politics undermine conversation about climate change through “greenwashing.” As such, Hollywood depictions of climate change are often romanticized, and serious conversation about it is swept under the rug. Blouin contends that the only way to target the issue is to be able to discuss the issue; unless media and literature open dialogue about climate change as it is, awareness will not improve. Blouin’s work offers a reason as to why texts sideline topics of climate change. His research can be helpful in establishing the political underbelly of climate change, and the parasitic nature of neoliberalism.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">In this chapter, Bull, Byrne, and Dupuis outline the benefits of incorporating YA fiction texts interdisciplinarily in schools. They argue that by using YA literature in different disciplines as a learning tool can better accommodate “reluctant readers” by exposing them to relevant texts and narratives that interest them. Not only will this increase learning but will also allow students to use critical thinking skills in a wide variety of topics, including science. Section 2 of their chapter focuses on environmentalism and the importance of curating a curriculum that connect interdisciplinary concepts to each other and to students’ lives. This section demonstrates how a text can be used to teach both the language arts and science so that students are able to receive a multimodal form of learning and deeper understanding of the topic. The authors draw out a framework using Ship Breaker by Paolo Bacigalupi as an example of how a potential curriculum could look. They focus on questions that broaden students’ understanding and motivation to learn further about the subject. This text will be particularly helpful in providing insights as to how using YA apocalypse novels to discuss topics of climate change and environmentalism will be beneficial in an academic setting. Using fiction narratives to teach students about real life problems can help target the very impending issue about climate change.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Couzelis argues that YA dystopian fiction lacks conversation about race. Using Uglies and
                      The Hunger Games as examples, Couzelis demonstrates the ways in which topics of race are either neglected, or
                      stereotypes are reinforced in these narratives. This article presents two supporting arguments that can be used to
                      build on research about the topic of climate change in YA fiction. The first argument: excluding conversations on
                      race in YA narratives coincides with the way climate change is also largely ignored. Couzelis showcases how
                      remnants of racial and individualistic bias (the humanist perspective) in politics has influenced what
                      conversations on climate change look like. Secondly, the article also highlights how biases against race
                      inadvertently magnify issues of race itself. By refusing to acknowledge race in narratives, racial minorities
                      remain othered, and their issues are received with skepticism and cynicism. Couzelis’ article asserts the
                      importance of viewing climate change using an intersectional lens and considering the impacts of race in
                      discussions about climate change.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Gaard pushes forth an intersectional lens when viewing climate change in fiction literature.
                      She talks about how narratives leave out certain disciplines, including race, gender, and sexuality, and how this
                      exclusion has affected the public opinion in their understanding of the subject, and how it influences policy
                      making. She proposes that by “bringing a critical ecofeminist standpoint … to illuminate the strengths and
                      shortcomings of literary narratives that present the problem of climate change from a (masculinist)
                      technological-scientific perspective” will give a more “complete restor(y)ing of climate change causes and
                      effects” (169). She hopes that by doing so will lead to a “greater potential to shape and contribute to activist
                      and policy-making discourses around climate justice” (169-70). Gaard presents readers with a short list of texts
                      that fall short or exemplify ecofeminist lens in their depiction of climate change. She examines the implications
                      of leaving out an ecofeminist perspective from analysis of texts, and how it influences public understanding and
                      opinion on the matter. Her section on children’s and YA climate change, in particular, focus on the potential to
                      empower and teach youth about the subject and motivate them towards ecosocial change. Yet, she notices that even
                      in this children’s literature, narratives offer only a narrowed lens on climate change that reinforces masculinist
                      technocratic perspectives and are influenced heavy by neoliberal capitalist agendas. Interestingly YA dystopian
                      literature presents young readers with a realist, intersectional understanding of climate change, as is seen in
                      The Carbon Diaries by Saci Lloyd, or The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, amongst others. In these novels,
                      narratives are written in the perspective of a growingly empowered female protagonist who must speak up against
                      injustices. Using her readings on YA dystopian novels, the value of the genre in academic settings, as well as
                      determining how its presentation on climate change can influence and further open up the definition of the
                      environment would be vital. Moreover, Gaard’s readings offer insight into the importance YA dystopian literature
                      in configuring an alternative mode of thinking and political structure for a better, imagined future.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Alice Curry argues that the relationship between human and nature as demonstrated in YA
                      fiction can help pave the way to a better understanding of the environment. Using an ecopoeisis lens to analyze
                      the texts Shadows Cast by Stars and The Interrogation of Ashala Wolf, she highlights the ways the relationship
                      between nature and human has been severed, and how this severance is later reconciled in the post-apocalypse. The
                      two narratives offer a “voice” to “nature’s self-realization,” and in this way question the type of relationship
                      that we hold with nature currently. The characters in the novels, for instance, develop two forms of
                      relationships, one being the humanist connection where nature is separate from human, and the other being
                      posthuman connection where nature and human are mutually connected to each other. Curry contends that the
                      posthuman is the solution to better understanding and recreating a connection with and to nature. Moreover, she
                      demonstrates how posthumanist perspectives in two narratives work to resist against colonialism and climate
                      change. Curry’s analysis on the posthuman body and the ways it interacts with nature outlines how narratives can
                      tackle against climate change by imagining a reconnection to nature that is balanced and interconnected with the
                      human body. More specifically, her analysis demonstrates how YA narratives can be taught to students so that they
                      can learn to question humanist beliefs prevalent in current politics, and to redefine their own relationship to
                      nature.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Deininger and Scammell explore the ways that ecofeminism works in Louise Lawrence’s YA short
                      fiction stories. They contend that ecofeminism is a significant part of understanding the politics of climate
                      change, and demonstrate the ways in which the female body works in parallel to the depiction of climate change.
                      Through their analysis, they argue that the oppression of the post-apocalyptic environment parallels that of the
                      female population. Freeing the plants and the flowers fall in line with the way women seek power. In this way,
                      tackling issues of climate change not only intersects with feminism, but also highlights issues of feminism that
                      need to be considered. Deininger and Scammell’s analysis emphasize the intersectionality of climate change, and
                      how it is not simply its own individual issue. Utilizing an ecofeminist lens to discuss climate change can
                      establish a helpful foundation to discuss the complicated relationship between climate change and feminism.
                      Understanding the connection between nature and the female body can give insight towards ways that narratives can
                      depict and discuss climate change that will push forth action in the real world.</div>

                      the “simulated ecology” in virtual games (53). Focusing specifically on the graphic novel by Cory Doctorow and Jen
                      Wang, In Real Life, Anastasia Salter analyzes the way nature is separated from the main character, Anda. Salter
                      demonstrates how “[t]he relationship of players with the virtual world is likewise one of ownership of space”
                      (53). She then, through close-readings, shows how the authors challenge and “reject digital utopianism” by using a
                      “multiplayer online-role-playing game as context for interrogating digital avatars as actors within a
                      virtualphysical environment space” (54). Salter delves into conversation about the binary of real world/digital
                      world, or natural ecology/ digital ecology, and shows how the lines between the two may not be as separate as is
                      believed. She posits that the role of imagination, and the blurring of person and their respective avatar “provide
                      an entrypoint into a larger conversation of the impact of play on the perception of responsibility and involvement
                      with an environment” (54). Salter, then, discusses how In Real Life offers an intersectional approach to its
                      narrative, and how this can be utilized in ecofeminist and ecocritical analysis. Her readings bring to focus the
                      ways in which narratives depict environments and how that plays into the depiction of its characters. Moreover,
                      her section on how the graphic novel presents the potential to connect character identities to their environment
                      brings forth an interesting role on how nature in digiscapes motivate social activism.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">This chapter delves into the way climate change is incorporated into Lloyd’ Saci’s The
                      Carbon Diaries, and how Lloyd’s portrayal of ecological disaster encourages political action on behalf of young
                      readers. The chapter considers how the genre of eco-dystopia offers outlooks into potential alternatives and
                      solutions that can help prevent the effects of climate change, or at the very least, alter the consequence of
                      climate change in the present world. The author argues that it is both a combination of hope and desire that is
                      necessary in dystopian literature: “The young readers expects—and needs—stories that are gripping but nevertheless
                      offer at least a promise that a better world will be possible.” Mossner then demonstrates how Lloyd incorporates
                      both elements (hope and desire) in The Carbon Diaries through the depiction of ecological catastrophe. She argues
                      that the novel is a “critical eco-dystopia” which blends utopian elements of hope and desire into dystopian
                      science fiction. The chapter then contends that “critical dystopian texts articulate a specific political agency
                      not only on the level of the narrative but also in terms of the reader’s relationship to the world, because they
                      open up a possibility for … ‘radical hope.’” Although the novel presents a dystopian world that eerily mimics
                      present-day situations, Lloyd also brings in a theme of hope to advocate for a potentially better future. This
                      chapter, and book, contains a few chapters such as “Educating Desire,” or “Dystopian Sacrifice” amongst others
                      which consider the benefits and disadvantages of eco-dystopias, and cli-fi. Chapters on the posthuman and this one
                      offer insight into the ways in which themes of hope can open dialogue for solutions for a better imagined future.

                    <div class="annotation">This chapter examines the relationship between female protagonists’ character awakening and
                      nature. McDonoguh and Wagner argue that there is a symbiotic relationship between female characters and nature in
                      which a female character gains her agency through her experiences with nature. She is both shaped by nature and
                      simultaneously shaping nature in order to claim her agency. The authors analyze three novels: Uglies by Scott
                      Westerfield, Matched by Ally Condie, and Delirium by Lauren Oliver to show how female agency and identity is
                      formed through and within nature. Using an ecofeminist lens, the authors discuss how the return to nature “is
                      exhibited through the unique opportunities in nature each female protagonist must face.” These opportunities
                      include “growing up, falling in love, and learning about herself,” which occurs once the female protagonist leaves
                      the safety of her home and interacts with nature. Through close-readings of each text, McDonough and Wagner
                      demonstrate how “[t]he process of awakening occurs” through the protagonists’ realization of her own actions upon
                      the world and “conclude with newly empowered female protagonists willing to claim their agency and act.” The
                      chapter outlines the importance of reading texts using an ecofeminist lens, and how through this relationship
                      offers room to restructure “understandings of both gender and nature within a larger culture framework.” The
                      chapter, and book, presents examines female identity and rebellion in dystopian fiction. Each chapter deconstructs
                      and analyzes how female bodies work within dystopian narratives, and what female rebellion can look like. It might
                      be interesting to examine the relationship of female identity and nature, and how that plays a part in discussion
                      on climate change. How does the depiction of female agency and nature work to create a close connection between
                      readers and nature? What are the implications of paralleling female identity to nature and our understanding of
                      climate change?</div>

                    <div class="annotation">In this chapter, McEvoy-Levy analyzes the political influence that The Hunger Games by
                      Suzanne Collins has on adolescent readers. He asks whether YA and pop-culture can cause young readers to revolt
                      against political and capitalist structures, and the effects of such movement. Sections on who YA literature is
                      targeting (adults as opposed to children), as well as the benefits of teaching young children about political
                      realities through fictional narratives is especially relevant to discussion on the importance of YA literature and
                      climate change. The effects of The Hunger Games on real-world political climates demonstrates how YA literature
                      can be used as a way to comment and actively engage with politics. Furthermore, analysis on real-world revolts
                      propelled by pop-media such as V for Vendetta as well as The Hunger Games reiterates the significance of the genre
                      in shaping political landscapes globally. McEvoy-Levy also considers the consequences of what The Hunger Games
                      does not talk about, such as race, and the implications of having such a gap in a narrative that took the world by
                      a storm. His discussion on the exploitation of the narrative through toys and fan-franchises also opens up a new
                      line of thought in terms of how revolt from pop-culture can also benefit capitalist structures by allowing them to
                      monetize off of it.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Thompson’s chapter contends that ‘home’ for protagonists in YA dystopian narratives
                      challenge the 19th century depiction of the term, and that ‘home’ extends beyond physical space. Using the two
                      novels, Unwind by Neal Shusterman (2007) and Ready Player One by Ernest Cline (2011), Thompson demonstrates how
                      defining a home space is vital for YA protagonists to form their identity and sense of subjectivity. She claims
                      that YA “narratives suggest what a young protagonist needs is to recognize that a true home or sanctuary is
                      created for oneself, based on one’s self-acceptance and experiences of places and people” (228). Sections on
                      virtual space and reality, as well as spaces such as the Graveyard as a source of autonomy plays an interesting
                      role in the depiction of nature. Although Thompson does not explicitly discuss topics of climate change or nature,
                      her analysis on the ways in which Connor and Wade’s homelessness and rebuilding of homes can be used to build
                      arguments on how nature and character agency works to define youth identity. It would be interesting to consider
                      how different natures (virtual reality, the “hyperreal,” v. urban neighbourhoods, impoverished neighbourhoods)
                      define agency and reality, as well as the relationship between control and autonomy for young characters.</div>
