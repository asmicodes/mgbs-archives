                    <div class="annotation">In this interview, Stephanie LeManger delves into the importance of cli-fi, and its influence in mainstream social activism and awareness. She discusses how cli-fi in pop culture in particular has opened conversation in the mainstream as well as academia about issues on climate change. LeManger contends that the inclusion of cli-fi in academia and mainstream has demonstrated the impact that fiction literature has on social change, advocating for or against political climates, and mediating social crises. She claims that cli-fi novels and films is a “gateway” towards social action. LeManger considers the absences evident in cli-fi literature, as well as our understanding of posthumanism (and the exclusion of Indigenous philosophies). She argues that “academic writing … is also a form of vitality … [and] that it is social action.” The interview tackles the process of writing, reading dystopian texts. It gives insight into the ways in which academica can beutilized as a form for social activism, and the importance of using these texts to better educate the general population.</div>
