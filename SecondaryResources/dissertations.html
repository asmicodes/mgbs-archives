                    <div class="annotation">Baudriller examines the importance and politicization of sci-fi over the ages. He argues that sci-fi has offered an abundance of narratives that tackle complex issues and conversations while also being accessible to the general population. He then considers the significance of dystopian novels in the understanding of current socio-political conversations. He notes a growing shift dystopian narratives where the “dull” and “idle” city-life is presented in comparison to the “wild” nature (10). He argues that “[t]he experience of nature is personal in these narratives” (11). His first chapter examines the “consequences of human hubris on the human body integrity” and the advocation to “return to the natural world” (13). This dissertation includes multiple chapters on nature, environment, and the human body. Baudriller examines the ways in which dystopian and post-apocalypse novels sever the human body from nature, how the environment is depicted in these novels and the effects of such depictions, and how deprivation of a natural earth (because it has been devastated by climate change) results in the shift towards an artificial nature. Baudriller’s chapters one and two, specifically, will be helpful in establishing a framework as to how discussions of climate change are portrayed in this genre. Using his analysis on The Uglies, for instance, could be helpful with determining the implications of severing ties with nature. Baudriller mentions but does not go in-depth about the effects of narratives that hinge on climate change but do not discuss it, such as when he analyzes The Road by Cormac McCarthy. As such, the text leaves room to discuss the implications of skirting around topics of climate change.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">In her thesis, Burgos Mascarell discusses the emerging young adult dystopian science-fiction genre, and its importance in current socio-political landscapes. She contends that “[u]nlike other narrative genres, utopian and dystopian fiction is highly related to sociology and politics.” Analyzing the following trilogies: The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, Uglies by Scott Westerfield, Divergent by Veronica Roth, and Across the Universe by Beth Revis, Burgos Mascarell examines the cultural, social, and psychological effects of each narrative on adolescent readers. She determines how narratives work to imitate and influence real life events, and readers’ understanding of their own worlds. This text focuses on the ways in which YA literature presents opportunity to take political action. Through the reflection of real-world events, these texts can be utilized to teach children how to engage with complex topics relevant to their own lives. Burgos Mascarell’s work outlines how YA dystopian literature offers a psychological and sociologically fulfilling experience that connects readers to both the fiction world and real-life.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Using an ecocritical lens, this thesis analyzes the texts, Life as We Knew It by Susan Beth
                      Pfeffer, The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, and The Knife of Never Letting Go by Patrick Ness to see how YA
                      literature “might influence readers’ attitudes toward the contemporary anxieties surrounding impending climate
                      change.” Dror examines how the relationship between the protagonist and non-human world is depicted in each novel,
                      and what this means for the “future of human survival.” She seeks to answer three questions: “1. What is the
                      representation of the natural environment in a selection of young adult dystopian literature? 2. What role does
                      technology play in a selection of young adult dystopian literature? And 3. How does the young adult protagonist
                      interact with the natural environment and technology in a selection of young adult dystopian literature?” Through
                      her analysis of each text, Dror demonstrates a separation between human and nature in which nature is deemed “an
                      antagonistic nonhuman space.” She examines how each protagonist undergoes a transformation with their
                      understanding of the world, and the implications of “inaction, spurred on by the perceived futility of their
                      rebellion.” Dror’s research outlines the ways in which nature and technology in dystopias “mirrors contemporary
                      twentyfirst century anxieties about human inaction towards climate change and technological reliance as well as
                      the resulting burden that is placed on the next generation.” She contends that the three novels present various
                      perspectives on the implications of inaction and the necessity of redefining a new relationship with nature. Her
                      work offers an ecocritical perspective in YA post-apocalypse literature and insight into the advantages of
                      utilizing dystopian literature as a way to propel action in youth.</div>

                        This thesis aims to define and establish the use and effects of the rite of passage into adulthood in dystopian literature for children and young adults. In accordance with the recent rise in popularity of dystopian fiction in both literature and film, the focus is on one of the first children’s novels of the genre, The Giver by Lois Lowry, on its three sequels, and on one of the most prominent trilogies in recent years, The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. The typical characteristics of dystopian novels have been established, and a comparative analysis of the novels in focus has been performed to reveal if and how they display differences in that respect. In the next step the stages of the rites of passage into adulthood have been explored and applied in the analysis of the novels under examination to establish their influence on the protagonists and their actions. It has been established that the protagonists move from one stage to the other and that in each stage they face the negative aspects of their dystopian environment and of the literary world they belong to. The consequences of their respective fictional societies become obvious in the final stage of the rites of passage into adulthood. It can be concluded that the protagonists abandon their rite of passage either to change their society and current order of social relationships or to eradicate it in attempt to replace it with a more tolerant society founded on awareness and free choice.

                    <div class="annotation">Finnisson defines dystopia and orients us with the ways in which dystopian novels hinge upon
                      environmental devastation and politics. Finnisson outlines the various themes embedded in these narratives, and
                      how dystopias are not simply imagined, devastated futures, rather they are compilations of past and present
                      events. He outlines how the 2008 market crash, for instance, led to readers “to connect more easily with the newly
                      published Hunger Games” because “[t]his was when young adults became increasingly aware that they could have a
                      slightly worse life than their parents” (3). Finnison also notes that dystopian literature is undergoing yet
                      another transformation in which “more female authors, and strong female characters” might be another factor in the
                      increasing demand for YA dystopian fiction as it “may serve to make the genre more appealing to a broader
                      audience” (3). Comparing “traditional dystopias” like Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell to more contemporary
                      dystopias, such as, The Handmaid’s Tale by Margaret Atwood, and The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, to showcase
                      how YA dystopias have progressed, how they differ, and what they offer to young readers. Finnison contends that
                      “more recent examples” of dystopias work to take warnings embedded in the narrative “to create new possibilities
                      for utopian hope within the space of the text” (5). Finnison examines why YA dystopias are becoming more popular,
                      and the implications of the increase in demand of the genre. He demonstrates how dystopian fiction allows young
                      readers to connect and understand the implications and “potential consequences” of technological and scientific
                      progress, the effects of growing biopolitics, and also offers youth the room to imagine “freedom in a world
                      influenced by biopolitics” (5). His article outlines how using YA dystopian novels in an academic setting will
                      help teach students of historical and present social and political issues. Furthermore, the texts open space to
                      discuss and challenge various issues such as climate change. By forming a relationship with the protagonist,
                      readers can emulate and embody forms of activism that is not taught elsewhere. The dissertation delves into the
                      ways in which dystopian novels promote strong and thinking female characters, and how this is echoed in youth. As
                      such, Finnisson’s readings offer insight into the advantages of utilizing YA texts in schools to teach political,
                      social, and environmental activism.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">In her dissertation, Hawkes attempts to tackle the absence of climate change in sci-fi
                      novels. She argues that “popular political narratives about climate change do not engage with the crisis in any
                      meaningful way,” which results in inaction on behalf of the general population (1). She believes that the
                      literature gap on topics of climate change hinder the average person’s understanding of the issue and “divert our
                      attention from the urgency of the crisis and the need for drastic change to our lifestyles and social systems”
                      (2). Hawkes examines how climate change is depicted in sci-fi and dystopian novels. She questions whether texts
                      start including topics of climate change after the term “global warming” is established, and whether the issue
                      will become more prevalent in more recently published narratives. Her ecocritical readings of the pre-1975 texts:
                      J. G. Ballard’s The Drowned World, Ursula Le Guin’s The Word For World Is Forest, and Walter Miller Jr.’s A
                      Canticle for Leibowitz, and post-1975 texts: Margaret Atwood’s MaddAddam trilogy (Oryx and Crake, The Year of the
                      5 Flood, and MaddAddam) as well as two novels by Paolo Bacigalupi: The Windup Girl and The Water Knife, explores
                      how environment is depicted and used as a plot element. Using an ecocritical lens, she analyzes how the texts
                      recognize “the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on the environment as well as human populations” and the
                      implications of each depiction. She argues that to better understand and evaluate discussions on climate change,
                      it is important to view them on a spectrum that recognizes the political ideologies that each narrative presents.
                      Hawke’s findings reveal the complicated nature of climate change in dystopian literature. Her analyses offer
                      insight into the multiple ways environment, nature, and climate change are represented in dystopian texts.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Leean’s thesis focuses on reiterating the importance of YA dystopian novels in an academic
                      setting. He uses three texts, The Giver by Lois Lowry, The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, and Legend by Marie Lu
                      to demonstrate the benefits of using them in elementary academic curriculums. Leean claims that because
                      contemporary YA dystopian fiction is now a part of the mainstream culture, it has “begun to lose credibility in
                      the academic setting;” however, he contends that “YA dystopian literature is an essential part of educating
                      students in critical thinking, for it allows for a creative and open space in which students may articulate the
                      problems they see in society, and then collaborate on ways in which these problems may be treated.” Leean’s
                      analysis of the three novels give insight into the complex political nature of the narrative, and the
                      socio-political awareness that is raised amongst young students when they are exposed to such narratives. Using
                      his case studies, this text offers discourse on not only the benefits of teaching YA dystopia in classroom, but
                      also ways to engage students with political themes and topics. Chapters on The Hunger Games, for instance, helps
                      to understand the political, historical and social backgrounds that are evident in YA dystopian fiction, and how
                      these can be drawn out in an interdisciplinary manner to educate children. Sections such as 2.4, 3.4, and 4.4,
                      take elements of the respective novel analyzed to explain how the narratives push forward political engagement in
                      their readers. Moreover, the chapter on eliciting social activism in students through these novels offer methods
                      of teaching and reading these texts that is both accessible and inspiring for children. Leean’s dissertation
                      offers an in-depth understanding of both the importance of YA dystopian fiction and the potential influence it can
                      have on the younger generation.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">The role of speculative fiction in its portrayal of climate change is examined in this
                      dissertation. Sparks examines different forms of climate change depiction, including part one “Capitalocene
                      Dreams” which talks about neoliberalism and the consequences of pushing forward a “collective lack of action” on
                      behalf of the general population, and part two “Hyper-Capitalism and Severe Climate Change” which examines
                      cultural effects such as overpopulation, pollution, and scarcity which leads to an environmental crisis. She
                      argues that “capitalism [is] the biggest issue of here and now—the underlying cause of ecological damage and
                      continuing unsustainability—and the greatest threat to our planet’s future.” The dissertation then focuses on
                      Anthropocene fiction as it develops into a new genre to see how it offers a new structural framework against the
                      looming threat of climate change. The section on “Capitalocene Dreams” offers multiple short stories that depict
                      the influence of neoliberal thought on climate change. In each story, a new element of political inaction and its
                      repercussions on the environment is brought to light as characters grapple with the aftereffects of such neglect.
                      Sparks begins the second part of her dissertation by outlining the history and significance of the term
                      “speculative fiction” and “sci-fi.” Although there has been a shift historically in the importance and value of
                      sci-fi, and climate change fiction has been labelled as a subgenre of sci-fi, Sparks contends that the genre of
                      sci-fi takes away from climate change fiction. Rather, climate change fiction should be its own separate genre.
                      She then continues to define the importance of short stories in the depiction of climate change. In a world that
                      has become more and more fast-paced and technological, she highlights arguments that claim that short fiction is
                      “compatible with smartphone culture, allowing for instant access.” The following chapters in the second section of
                      her thesis outline the historical and political background of speculative fiction, climate fiction, and the
                      influence it has on the general population. Her final two chapters are particularly relevant to the genres of
                      climate change fiction, and the ability to reframe imagined future political structures to better the world that
                      we live in.</div>
