The essays discuss how the genres “teach serious lessons about the issues faced by humanity, and [offer] readers a pleasurable retreat from their quotidian experience" (5). Basu, Broad, and Hintz’ essay focuses on dystopian fiction and identity politics. Through her analysis of Divergent by Veronica Roth, and Curse Workers Series by Holly Black, the authors work to examine the significance of an “essential self” and the ways in which politics inhibits it. The following sections then focus on body surveillance and space, and how that works with developing identity. Von Mossner and Baccolini’s essay in part two discusses “critical eco-dystopia” through her analysis of the Carbon Diaries. This section would be helpful in understanding how environment and relationship with nature can develop political identities. Finally, part four looks into posthumanism and biotechonologies to see how YA fiction can depict better futures. Their readings focus on how relationships with space, environment, and nature work to build political identities amongst youth. Their discussion on posthumanism as a source of reconciliation between nature and the human highlight alternative ways cli-fi literature can be taught and read to establish a personal and collaborative relationship
                      with the world.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">This book defines dystopia and post-apocalypse internationally, showcasing the way the term changes from nation to nation. The text delves into the colonial and capitalistic histories that influence the depiction of post-apocalypse and dystopian worlds. Sections including: “The Cultural Logic of Post-Capitalism: Cormac McCarthy’s The Road and Popular Dystopia” by Carl F. Miller, “The Dystopia of the Obsolete”: Lisa Robertson’s Vancouver and the Poetics of Nostalgia” by Paul Stephens, “Post-Frontier and Re-Definition of Space in Tropic of Orange” by Hande Tekdemir, and “Our Posthuman Adolescence: Dystopia, Information Technologies, and the Construction of Subjectivity in M.T. Anderson’s Feed” by Richard Gooding, tackle concepts most relevant to climate change, nature, and identity in dystopias and post-apocalypse fiction. Gooding’s chapter examines the “difficulty of reconciling dystopian pessimism with the traditional hopefulness” of dystopian fiction in M.T. Anderson’s Feed. His close reading of the novel demonstrates how environment, nature, and technology influences the protagonist’s identity and subjectivity. Stephen’s chapter analyzes Lisa Robertson’s poetry and prose to see the ways in which space, nature, and history defines identity. He explores how Robertson uses space to critique “the political mechanisms of capitalist society” and to “resituate [women] historically” by engaging in practices of nostalgia and obsolescence (252). Miller’s chapter analyzes The Road by Cormac McCarthy and argues that the novel’s “depiction of post-capitalism and the loss of a global economy results in a hyper-localized and hopelessly fragmented notion of humanity. In such a way, The Road provides a striking theoretical commentary on the legacy of capitalism and projects an overwhelmingly dystopian view of the loss of popular and consumer culture” (161). The chapter focuses on “whether history can survive the inverse triumph of nature of modernization” (198). The bookoffers multiple close readings of texts that examine human relationship with nature, the posthuman and adolescent identity, as well as the influence of capitalism and post-capitalism in imagined futures.</div>

                      (2015) by Margaret Atwood, The Feed (2002) by M.T. Anderson, Cloud Atlas (2004) by David Mitchell and Never Let Me
                      Go (2005) by Kazuo Ishiguro to show how neoliberal network power inhibits any course of action against systematic
                      oppression. She presents the ways in which neoliberal beliefs are internalized by society which, in turn, prevents
                      people from even understanding the extent to their powerlessness. As such, the motivation to rebel is drastically
                      reduced. In her analyses, Gonnerman shows how neoliberal capitalism removes the possibility of being able to hope
                      or imagine utopia which is seen in narratives that can imagine “the end of the world, the total destruction of the
                      human race, yet not of an alternative to free market capitalism” (67). She contends that because of neoliberal
                      network power, which is “a peculiar mix of individual agency and systemic coercion” there is no single figurehead
                      or group to rebel against, which is why characters in the selected texts do not even fathom revolutionary action
                      (72). Gonnerman’s book offers an in-depth look into the political, specifically neoliberal schema, evident in
                      literature that prevents revolution or rebellions from occurring. She showcases how neoliberal policies can
                      immobilize a group of people and placate them in treacherous and unjust situations. Using her readings, it would
                      be interesting to see the ways in which YA dystopian novels parallel, or resist neoliberalist thought, and the
                      effects of such depictions.</div>

                      conflict. It argues that Western political agendas, neoliberalism, and peacekeeping, or state-building, policies
                      have further exacerbated the dissent between the two nations. Although this text does not directly connect to
                      research on climate change in YA literature, it does offer in-depth analysis of political parties and practices
                      that are then mirrored in YA dystopian novels. For instance, chapters on neoliberalism and how neoliberalist
                      agendas actually reinforced the conflict can be helpful in establishing how political agendas in YA novels control
                      discussions on certain themes such as climate change. Part I and II of the book might be helpful in defining terms
                      such as neoliberalism or “peace-keeping,” and can be generalized to show how it works in fictional narratives.
                      Using this as a framework, further analysis on the political realm of climate change, and its control in fiction
                      can be explored.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Harrison’s book delves into the posthuman perspective in dystopian YA fiction. Harrison
                      examines the relationship with human and nature, highlighting how the humanist perspective severs human connection
                      with nature. Through her analysis of texts such as Unwind by Neal Shusterman or The Dead-Tossed Waves by Carrie
                      Ryan, amongst many others, Harrison shows how dystopian environments are depicted as wild and foreign, thereby
                      depicting the human body as incompatible with such environments. She examines the consequence of such severance
                      and what the posthumanism has to offer. Chapters one to five explore the posthuman and its relation to climate
                      change and environment. These chapters examine texts that entirely neglect or partially include concepts of
                      posthumanism. In her analysis of Unwind by Neal Shusterman, she shows how “by mapping the effects of consumer
                      culture directly onto the human body, the humanist hero of neoliberal capitalism is revealed as nothing more than
                      a marketing ploy which, if undermined, might give way to more sustainable communities based on collective
                      empowerment” (68). Her final two chapters move onto discuss narratives that follow non-linear narratives, and
                      entirely embrace the posthuman perspective. These analyses can be helpful in demonstrating the ways in which YA
                      novels present climate change, or relationships between nature and human. Harrison’s work demonstrates how YA
                      fiction offer “complex agendas and ideologies” that challenge humanist systems and imagine “posthuman
                      possibilities” (119). She argues that YA fiction offers readers to think critically about their “social
                      responsibility, and the consequences of their own and others’ actions” (119). Moreover, these novels offer young
                      readers to imagine a better future for themselves by teaching them the hostility of their current environment and
                      presenting them alternative frameworks to reconcile their connections to nature.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Heidi’s book explores the way art, opera, and music discuss themes of climate change.
                      Analyzing compositions such as Mozart’s Requiem, along with other soundtracks for nature documentaries, or opera’s
                      such as “Persephone in the Late Anthropocene,” Heidi outlines the ways in which sounds and silence work to
                      highlight the issue of climate change. The chapter on Persephone seems to be an especially interesting piece that
                      examines the way absences work to connect with audiences. Sections about Anselm Kiefer who uses myth of Persephone
                      to depict preservation of “earth as a damaged artifact” through art, or analysis on how the songless opera
                      emphasizes the urgency and prevalence of climate change opens up an interesting conversation on how
                      experimentation and multimedia pieces can better spread the message. Heidi’s examination of the “hyperobject”
                      which is something that “eludes easy definition and response” and her analysis of “Writing of the Disaster” is the
                      most relevant to our research on climate change. Using her finding, it would be interesting to see how YA
                      literature experiments, or could experiment, with the physical form of storytelling to make its point more
                      explicitly on climate change. Similarly, it might be interesting to focus on the absences in YA novels to see how
                      they embody the “hyperobject.” Lastly, her readings of the posthuman in these artworks can be helpful to build on
                      the idea of how climate change should be read and analyzed in texts.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Mehnert examines the effects of sci-fi and the necessity of imagination to understand
                      climate change. She notices how “there is no transnational institution that deals with issues related to climate
                      change on a global scale.” Mehnert points at the accountability placed on individuals and argues that
                      individuality and small local movements, although helpful, “prevent us from envisioning alternative perspectives”
                      that can take place on a global scale. Using current examples, Mehnnert demonstrates the elusiveness of the
                      definition of climate change, and how that has added to the inability to properly tackle it. Mehnert argues that
                      even science itself has a realm of fiction because of how elusive climate change is which has led to the bigger
                      dilemma of discerning what is real or not, rather than imagining possible solutions. As such, Mehnert advocates
                      for the importance of using sci-fi as a tool to better understand climate change. Analyzing the German text,
                      Maeva! by Dirk C. Fleck, Mehnert demonstrates how his journalistic writing style and worlds that closely resemble
                      real-life enhances readers’ connection to climate change. Fleck offers a text that encourages readers to find
                      solutions towards the impending environmental catastrophe by forming “an environmental world citizenship.”
                      Mehnert’s analysis draws out the way Fleck’s text pushes forth a solution that works to connect everyone globally,
                      politically, and to nature. By mirroring his narrative to real-world issues, Fleck’s writing can be used as a
                      basis to tackle current environmental issues. This article considers the importance of narratives that fill in the
                      blanks, and that offer solutions to current issues. Mehnert highlights the importance of imagination to understand
                      and create change.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">Parr discusses the ways in which climate change has become politicized and neoliberalized.
                      She talks about how understanding climate change using a neoliberal perspective affects and inhibits social
                      change. She presents the ways neoliberal agendas influence consumption, diets, and media portrayal of climate
                      change and how this impacts preventative action from being taken. Parr’s book demonstrates how neoliberalist
                      strategies to solve climate change are only “distractions” while in reality “what persists is the condition of
                      violence embedded in neoliberal capitalism as it robs each and every one of us (other species and ecosystems
                      included) of a future.” Chapters one and two work to show how carbon markets and ulterior motives of neoliberal
                      agendas fail to actually tackle the issue of climate change and instead, further exacerbate the situation. Chapter
                      three highlights how the politicized and neoliberal climate change exploits women and vulnerable people. Chapter
                      eight delves into the oil industry and the shortcomings of dealing with oil spills. She considers the ecological
                      disasters caused by these oil spills, and how it is necessary to reconfigure the ways in which we treat failures.
                      Parr warns about the potential degradation of the world if solutions towards climate change remain the same. Her
                      work can be used to determine how YA fiction represents ecological disaster and the implications of the methods
                      advocated to tackle it. Parr’s book offers an intersectional analysis of climate change that can be used to
                      explain why there is a large gap in the literature on topics of climate change. Furthermore, her insights on the
                      influences of neoliberalist politics can help with understanding how they work in narratives on youth and social
                      activism.</div>

                    <div class="annotation">This book interrogates the political structures and failures in the Western world and
                      considers potential frameworks for a post-political environment. Swyngedouw considers how moves towards
                      depolitization, or the reconfiguration of democracies, have emerged. He demonstrates how the growing
                      disenchantment with Western democracies is leading to revolts that fight for depoliticization, and how
                      post-politicization “ensures that the framework of debate and decision making does not question or disrupt the
                      existing state of the neoliberal political-economic configuration.” The key question that he asks is, whether “and
                      how progressive and emancipatory politics can still be thought and practiced in the twentyfirst century.” The book
                      resides its argument on the two images of “the city” and “nature” to depict the postdemocratic modes of
                      governance. The book begins by demonstrating how neoliberal politics has resulted in “the disappearance of the
                      urban qua “polis.” It then outlines the history of post-politicization and orients readers on “the
                      socio-ecological predicament the world is in.” The second part of the book focuses on the political perceptions of
                      ‘nature,’ and how it functions in the process of depoliticization. Moreover, the second part of the book focuses
                      on the political negligence on topics of climate change. Finally, the book considers the role of rebellions and
                      revolts to repoliticize urban life and suggests political frameworks that could potentially reconfigure
                      democracies into systems that are “progressive and emancipatory.” Chapters 4, 5, and 6, in particular, focus on
                      ecological roles in politics, and climate change in the post-political world. For instance, in chapter 4,
                      Swygnedouw examines the paradox in our understanding of nature. He highlights how politics have divulged two
                      potential treatments of nature: one, in which nature is “predicated upon feverishly developing new natures …
                      forcing nature to act in a way we deem sustainable or socially necessary,” while, two, also understanding that in
                      order for survival, nature must be returned “to a presumably more benign condition” (65). He then contends that
                      the term ‘nature’ itself is politicized and ambiguous and considers the implications of using such term. Chapters
                      on climate change and environment offer political insight into the ways sustainability contradicts itself, the
                      issue with ‘nature’ in politics, and potential reframing of the issue to rectify or, at the very least, narrow and
                      form a coexisting space to understand rebuild a better, more inclusive political structure.</div>
